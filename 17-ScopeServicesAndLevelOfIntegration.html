<h3>Scope, Services, and Level of Integration</h3>

<p>Taking another tack, the focus of attention could be placed on the functionality as it relates to the statement on the website calling itself “the official online state resource for information, filings, and personal assistance to start or maintain a Kansas business.”  In that case, while it appears that it addresses less than 1% of the business filings that could be required for the 360+ business types regulated in some form by the state as reported in the Network Kansas publication “Steps to Success: A Step-by-step Guide to Starting a Business”.  (See Proposed Use Cases and Requirements section), it does provide some portion of the functionality required to form a business in Kansas. From an integration perspective, only the Kansas Secretary of State’s applications were reviewed as part of this report.   However, one approach available here would be to inventory the systems that support business registration and licensing in the state, prioritize them based on the scope of functionality targeted for the site, and then judge progress to-date against that measure.  While this is beyond the scope of effort for this report, further work in this area is addressed in the Recommendations and Next Steps section.</p>

<p>While during the course of this review, there has been considerable discussion about the possibility, need, and desire for broadening the horizontal reach of the Kansas Business Center to include additional state agencies, the scope of the agencies included appears to have remained close to the same for the last ten years.  In fact, the May 23, 2003 submission for a National Association of State Chief Information Officers award made by accessKansas (previous branding of the state portal) indicated that Unemployment Insurance Liability Determinations were available through the KBC at that time – this appears to no longer be the case.</p>

<p>The specific services currently available through the Kansas Business Center are listed in the section labeled Transactions above.  Several aspects are notable:</p>

<p>At least one service related to forming a business with employees is missing. While it appears that the core services required to form a business are linked to in some fashion on the website, for a business that will have employees, there is no connection shown to the Department of Labor’s Unemployment Insurance determination application.</p>

<p>There are a number of services shown that cannot be performed entirely online.  Whether this is due to statutory or policy barriers, or technical/resource limitations related to the site, it leaves the impression that there are additional efficiencies to be achieved.  It is also not clear what services are not listed that might also be added to the KBC as it relates to business registration and filing required to form an entity.</p>

<p>The ability to obtain a federal tax identification number is not integrated.  The federal tax ID would require work with the federal government, but integration with the Kansas Department of Revenue to maintain application “flow” when establishing a business seems an important goal.</p>

<p>Payment Functionality/Shopping Cart. The Kansas Business Center makes use of “KanPay”, a proprietary payment engine offered through the Kansas Information Consortium.   This payment approach lacks full “shopping cart” functionality integrated into the site. However, absent testing or an examination of the underlying technology, it appears to serve the purpose it was designed for.</p>

<p>There does not appear to be any integration with registration/licensing of business “type”.  While this could be considered a notable omission, a number of business one-stop websites in other states do not extend functionality beyond business formation. Including this functionality to allow end-to-end registration and licensing of users for particular business types is possible, but it appears to be a very significant effort, both from the cost and effort required to create, and to maintain such functional integration on an ongoing basis. To be successful, this integration should also recognize that significant portions of the registration and licensing for business type require vertical integration to the county or city level. A mature approach to this functionality will also require a commonly agreed upon approach to authentication and data sharing if it is to streamline the process for the user. Given some of the challenges outlined in the Vision and Governance section that follows, expanding the scope of the KBC in this manner will require a strong vision, dedicated resources, and full executive sponsorship.</p>
