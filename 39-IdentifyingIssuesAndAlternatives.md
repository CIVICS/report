##Identifying Issues and Alternatives

In evaluating next steps for the State, consider the evidence accumulated during the course of this study:

* Planning efforts that have been on again, off again with little progress – from conversations with other states, this situation is not unique to Kansas

* No formal executive committee is currently convened to oversee or direct efforts to maintain or grow the current Kansas Business Center

* Basic technological building blocks at the enterprise level are missing: single sign-on,   published standards or governance for web services or data sharing; resources and priorities are focused on internal improvements that may support greater integration in the future, but are not available now

* No clear source of dedicated funding or human resources of the scale shown to be required by efforts in other states to develop or maintain a fully integrated statewide system exists

Alternatively, the following capabilities exist:

* The State has a willing partner in Network Kansas that has deep experience working with Kansas businesses.

* The Governor’s office has met with and agreed on joint sponsorship of a project to reinvent the Kansas Business Center that would be led by the Secretary of State with the full support of the cabinet and Executive branch.

* The INK Board has dedicated seed money of approximately $450,000 (remaining) to the effort to reinvent the Kansas Business Center.

* Centers of expertise exist in some agencies on the development of standardized web services for data sharing between agencies and with external parties.

* A common desire exists across both state agencies involved in business formation and licensing and those businesses to deploy an account management system of some type. 

* The current vendor for the Information Network of Kansas has worked on implementation of business one-stop projects in other states and can provide assistance in offering a federated ID service for business formation and filing transactions.

While the situation includes significant challenges, Kansas is uniquely positioned to move forward with some of the innovations discussed earlier – implementation can be incremental, while adding high value, and not resource intensive.  Before considering alternatives, however, the following sections outline some of the key features that appear to be lacking, as well as desirable, in a future Kansas Business Center suite of services.
