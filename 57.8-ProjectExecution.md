###Project Execution

Earlier in the Identification and Evaluation of Alternatives section of this report, the recommendation was to pursue two paths in parallel.  The first was to Deploy a Toolbox for Intergovernmental Business Registration and Filing. If the state is to embark on a KBC 3.0 project, the four elements of that strategy should be pursued from the outset. Proposed approaches for two items from that strategy deserve special mention here:

#### Recommendation B-5

Implement Federated Identity as a Service. 

Approach INK to offer federated identity services for state agency business filers. As noted in the Strategic Context of this Initiative section earlier in this report, the state declared interest in a single sign-on solution for business as early as 2010, but that approach is not yet currently in place.

INK was created for the purpose of “routing around” bureaucracy and the long planning and implementation cycles of traditional government.  The Board can easily work with third party providers to create an identity offering that could be used to streamline interactions with business.  It is also possible that an existing credential, such as the username and password approach currently used by a popular business partner like the Kansas Department of Revenue or Department of Labor could be extended for this purpose. Whatever the approach, the implementation of federated identity could jumpstart innovation efforts in this and other areas of government service delivery.

#### Recommendation B-6

Pursue account management functionality for use in business filing statewide.

It is not clear whether this could be developed as a freestanding service, in concert with federated ID, or as an extension of account management functionality currently in place at INK, or even that planned or used like the Kansas Department of Revenue.  However, as explained as part of a previous discussion, this type of functionality is sorely needed, and may be able to be built free-standing, whether or not a project to build some type of comprehensive integrated filing center is undertaken.


Until final decisions have been made on scope and agency participation, it is difficult to provide detailed cost and planning information for a KBC 3.0 project.  However, the execution phase of this project should follow the standard methodology for Information Technology projects in use at the State of Kansas.  To start, a project charter should be developed that includes a clear and commonly accepted scope. Efforts should be made to develop detailed requirements that incorporate the information outlined in this document.  In reviewing materials from other states, the State of Indiana Business One-Stop project appears to have many commonalities with the overall scope, if not the identical technical approach, as the State of Kansas, and this was confirmed by our conversation with them.  The Information Network of Kansas Board and those sponsors and agencies that will be associated with this project should review the project planning materials they have developed and make use of these artifacts in crafting an approach to the Kansas Business Center 3.0 project.
