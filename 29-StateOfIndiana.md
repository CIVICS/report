####State of Indiana 

The Indiana Secretary of State’s office is leading a multi-agency project to implement a business one-stop portal based on legislation (HB 1006) passed in 2011. The legislation directs all state agencies to participate in the maintenance and development of the site at the request of the Secretary of State. The project is focused on business formation (set up of the business entity, prior to taking the step to identify and perform the transactions necessary to engage in a particular type of business). As a result, the steering committee is made up of representatives from the Governor’s office, the Secretary of State’s office, the Department of Revenue, the Department of Workforce Development, and the Indiana Office of Technology (central IT). Indiana focused on business formation because it touched the highest percentage of businesses. 

The requirements gathering, communication, and RFI/RFP process is being supported by a consulting firm, Baker Tilly, who worked with the state to develop requirements, the project charter and the RFI and RFP at a cost roughly in the $500K-$800K range. A Request for Information (RFI) was released and responded to in the summer and a Request for Proposal is scheduled to be posted in mid-October 2013.  From a technical perspective, the approach has not yet been decided on. However, the state does not have enterprise single sign-on, and the project executive feels that this technology will be a central key to success.  There is not a common business identifier in use across agencies yet, but some way to address that issue is expected as an outcome of the project. Based on a review of the RFI’s and previous research, it seems unlikely that a commercial off-the-shelf product will meet the needs of the state. They will try to leverage existing systems as much as possible and not build new ones. One goal in this initiative that was emphasized is to assure that functionality is delivered in chunks to mitigate risk as there was a previous initiative in this area that was led by the central technology office that was not successful. They perceive there to be a line beyond which bringing in additional functionality dramatically increases the risk of failure and include a list of 10 risks and their mitigation strategies in the Project Charter.

A review of the RFI documents shows the following expectations about the duration of the project after the project charter and roadmap were complete: RFI and Requirements Gathering (3-4 months); RFP Development, Vendor Evaluation and Selections (2-4 months); Solution Development and Initial Implementation (9-15 months) for an overall project duration of 14-23 months. Including time to organize the project (3-4 months), the window appears to be 18-24 months. The roadmap included in the charter envisions tiers – described as “horizons” - of functionality across the three agencies involved in business formation, and provide justification for the prioritization of what is included in each.
