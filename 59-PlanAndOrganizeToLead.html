<h3>Plan and Organize to Lead</h3>

<p>The INK Board and Executive Director must begin planning and organizing to lead.</p>

<h3>Recommendation C-1</h3>

<p>Partner with National Leaders in Government 3.0 Innovation to Contribute to Current INK Strategic and Business Planning Efforts - Including Identification of New Initiatives and Partnership Opportunities.</p>

<p>Contacting and attracting the participation of these leaders and leading organizations is not intended simply to put words to paper, but to have vigorous discussions to frame the business of INK in new ways, to discover new opportunities, and develop new partnerships that can create an “innovation engine” at INK for the long-term.
Examples of leaders and organizations include (but are not limited to):
Code for America (Jen Pahlka, on leave as U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officer)
New Urban Mechanics (Nigel Jacob, Co-founder, New Urban Mechanics)
Kauffman Labs (Bo Fishback, Vice President for Entrepreneurship)
Google (Ginny Hunt, Principal, Strategy and Civic Innovation)
MIT (Dr. Sandy Pentland, MIT Media Lab Entrepreneurship and Innovations)
Governance Lab (Beth Noveck, cofounder; Joel Gurin, advisor)
Open Data Institute (Gavin Starks, Chief Executive Officer)
Data.gov (Jeanne Holm, Data.gov Evangelist at GSA)
Open Knowledge Foundation (Jonathan Gray, Director of Policy and Ideas)
Center for Technology in Government (Theresa Pardo, Director)</p>

<h3>Recommendation 2</h3>

<p>Form a standing Innovation Committee of the Board devoted to continuous exploration of opportunities for public and private partnerships for innovative delivery and use of government information.</p>

<p>The Board must maintain a constant focus on bringing in innovative ideas and opportunities for partnership and investment for evaluation and to raise the awareness of the Board members on industry and government trends in data sharing and service delivery.</p>

<p>The Board of Directors of the Information Network of Kansas directs its Executive Director to work with the Board Innovation Committee established under Recommendation 2 to reach out to the parties and organizations outlined in Recommendation 1 in the Plan to Organize and Lead section of the Kansas Business Center: Opportunities for Innovation report with the intent of soliciting their participation in brainstorming and discussions about potential innovations that can be introduced into the INK model and opportunities for partnership.</p>
