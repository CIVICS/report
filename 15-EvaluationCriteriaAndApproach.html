<h2>Evaluation: Kansas Business Center (2.0)</h2>

<h3>Evaluation Criteria and Approach</h3>

<p>The Kansas Business Center has been deployed as an online destination for Kansas businesses for a little over ten years.  Extrapolating from recent information provided about its use, the site has likely received millions of page views during its life to-date and is considered an integral part of service delivery to new and existing businesses by a key partner in supporting business activity in the state, Network Kansas.</p>

<p>From this perspective, the Kansas Business Center can be considered a success.  The fact that content from Network Kansas is delivered in association with the website, and that a “live chat” feature is available to support users attempting to navigate the process of starting or maintaining a business is a real plus. Finally, in a review of both state and Information Network of Kansas planning documents, and a strategic plan for economic development in the state, enhancement of the Kansas Business Center continues to be featured as a goal. While it is as an outgrowth of this interest that this report was commissioned, the standard against with to measure the success of the Kansas Business Center has not been clearly stated to-date.  Absent this, multiple perspectives can be used. We have settled upon the following four criteria as critical at this point in its development.</p>
