# Improvements to the Existing Kansas Business Center

The first set of recommendations targets short-term improvements related to the current iteration of the Kansas Business Center.  However, their main objective is to lay the foundation for the Kansas Business Center 3.0 project while increasing the usability of the existing site and services.
Unified Governance and Sponsorship

At present, while there is strong interest in improving the business climate in Kansas and in removing obstacles to business formation in the state, lack of clarity on the ownership, executive sponsorship, and distribution of roles and responsibilities around the existing Kansas Business Center makes progress difficult.  A central point of coordination for defining goals and success measures, marshalling resources, and advocating for the joint delivery of services to customers is currently lacking.  The INK Board should advocate for and participate in new Kansas Business Center governance as part of a revised Board vision that focuses on the economic development value of government information (see recommendations Information Network of Kansas Support for Innovation and Entrepreneurship).

### Recommendation A-1

Establish High-Level KBC Governance and Sponsorship

The Information Network of Kansas Board should advocate with the Secretary of State and Governor to establish governance for the existing Kansas Business Center.  The group would initially be charged with setting a vision and goals for the Kansas Business Center 3.0 while identifying and implementing short-term improvements in the existing site.
The governance should be composed primarily of business stakeholders (to be expanded or revised over time as the Vision requires) such as the following:
Secretary of State
Governor’s Office
Two representatives from the business community
Network Kansas
Department of Commerce
Department of Revenue
Department of Labor
Department of Administration
Information Network of Kansas
The committee should seek advice from existing groups (members of the business community, associations, or internal subject matter experts) along with the Governor’s Council of Economic Advisors. Technical resources (CITO, agency CIOs, vendors) should be consulted where appropriate, with additional advisory groups established only where necessary to avoid depleting momentum.

Several key areas of information that would be useful in the identification of existing issues and options for resolution related to the current Kansas Business Center, as well as in planning and goal setting for the Kansas Business Center 3.0, appear to be missing.  While the ability to translate this information into action is predicated on the establishment of formalized governance (see preceding recommendation), the following data points provide sample metrics that could be useful, along with examples of how they might be used:

Enhanced web traffic and site usage profiles.  Inbound link profile (what sites are linking in to the KBC; what the traffic interaction is, if any, between KBC and Network Kansas websites); Search terms being used to bring users to the site and by users on the site; Page abandonment (where users stop or leave the site) as well as shopping cart and related payment engine abandonment.  This information can be used to perform Search Engine Optimization (SEO) activities as well as improve the usability of the existing site and assist in planning for future efforts.

KBC Registered user profiles. Statistics on current KBC registered users in terms of activity (length of subscription (new this period vs. repeat), frequency of use, transaction profile); Number of Kansas.gov subscribers vs. total number of KBC users, and similar statistics as well as trends.  This information can be used to better understand user community and their behavior and level of use of current KBC as a baseline for improvement and incorporated in planning – and perhaps outreach – for a new Kansas Business Center.

Business Formation, Registration/Licensing statistics.  Integrated view of the relationship in levels of licensing activities at the two agencies that the KBC is a “feeder” for to understand what percent of licensing is driven by the KBC and associated trends, existing state and trends in electronic v. paper filing and related statistics.  Example use is to better understand current effectiveness, role, impact re: the Kansas Business Center as it relates to business formation transactions executed.

### Recommendation A-2

Establish Data-Driven Foundation for Assessing KBC Performance 

As part of advocacy for independent governance for the Kansas Business Center, the Information Network of Kansas Board should recommend and dedicate resources to supporting enhanced data analysis related to KBC traffic and transactions in line with the examples outlined above.
