# Improvements to the Existing Kansas Business Center

The first set of recommendations targets short-term improvements related to the current iteration of the Kansas Business Center.  However, their main objective is to lay the foundation for the Kansas Business Center 3.0 project while increasing the usability of the existing site and services.
Unified Governance and Sponsorship

At present, while there is strong interest in improving the business climate in Kansas and in removing obstacles to business formation in the state, lack of clarity on the ownership, executive sponsorship, and distribution of roles and responsibilities around the existing Kansas Business Center makes progress difficult.  A central point of coordination for defining goals and success measures, marshalling resources, and advocating for the joint delivery of services to customers is currently lacking.  The INK Board should advocate for and participate in new Kansas Business Center governance as part of a revised Board vision that focuses on the economic development value of government information (see recommendations Information Network of Kansas Support for Innovation and Entrepreneurship).

### Recommendation A-1

Establish High-Level KBC Governance and Sponsorship

The Information Network of Kansas Board should advocate with the Secretary of State and Governor to establish governance for the existing Kansas Business Center.  The group would initially be charged with setting a vision and goals for the Kansas Business Center 3.0 while identifying and implementing short-term improvements in the existing site.
The governance should be composed primarily of business stakeholders (to be expanded or revised over time as the Vision requires) such as the following:
Secretary of State
Governor’s Office
Two representatives from the business community
Network Kansas
Department of Commerce
Department of Revenue
Department of Labor
Department of Administration
Information Network of Kansas
The committee should seek advice from existing groups (members of the business community, associations, or internal subject matter experts) along with the Governor’s Council of Economic Advisors. Technical resources (CITO, agency CIOs, vendors) should be consulted where appropriate, with additional advisory groups established only where necessary to avoid depleting momentum.
