<h3>Technology</h3>

<p>Along with the review of the user-facing functionality of the Kansas Business Center, we anticipated conducting a high-level review of the technology platforms that support it.<br/>
However, we were not able to examine the code or infrastructure supporting it directly to evaluate the capabilities of the technical architecture for extensibility.
The primary technology footprint supporting the Kansas Business Center is provided by the Information Network of Kansas. From conversations with technicians familiar with the application, it appears that the components of the current site involve the use of HTML, Java, Java Server Pages (JSP), XML, CSS, Perl, SQL, and the Struts framework.  It also appears that permissions from some of the SQL select permissions are created in a way that can emulate “federation” of (cross-agency) access to the data.  The Secretary of State’s office reports that in most cases the online application duplicates databases that then replicate data and transaction records to core systems at the agency. The architecture was not confirmed for the Kansas Department of Revenue applications.</p>

<p>Because an important question about the future direction of the Kansas Business Center revolves around the extensibility of the current architecture, the lack of a more detailed evaluation of this issue is an important omission from this report.  However, this issue will need to be revisited as part of any formal project to reinvent and extend the KBC.  A cursory evaluation of technical approach in use is provided in the corresponding portion of following evaluation and general recommendations are contained in the Recommendations and Next Steps section of this report.</p>
