<h3>The Fourth Option</h3>

<h5>Given this situation, the State of Kansas should instead select a fourth option that involves moving forward on two parallel paths, further elaborated in the Recommendations and Next Steps section.</h5>

<p>Path 1: Deploy Toolbox for Intergovernmental Business Registration and Filing</p>

<p>The state should pursue an incremental approach to build out of registration and licensing functionality by:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>REST. Actively encouraging the development and publishing of standardized web services (REST or other technologies) to allow communication and data exchange between existing systems. Such services can be incrementally developed and implemented between and among agencies as negotiated via small or large cooperative efforts.</p></li>
<li><p>Accommodate filings originating in consumer and business software, service bureaus, and other intermediaries.  Even more important than encouraging the incremental deployment of interagency web services is the need to focus on more seamlessly enabling business filings by service bureaus and other intermediaries (accountants, attorneys, business services firms).  Many times, individuals and businesses work with private sector firms that end up using software to create government filings that are, in turn, printed and mailed in for lack of an electronic interface between their software and the state’s electronic filing systems – only to be rekeyed into a state system upon receipt. Automating services in this area can provide a bottom-line benefit to businesses, citizens, and the state and should be considered an immediate priority for state agencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Federated ID. Deploy federated identification services – through a third-party white label provider, through the Information Network of Kansas, or some other means – including consideration of leveraging existing authentication for the Kansas Department of Revenue business filing – to enable single sign-on for business registration across agencies.  Such authentication should support “step-up”, so that those agencies requiring additional authentication can be enabled to do so as part of the functionality.</p></li>
<li><p>Account Management.  To ease interaction with the state for its business customers, and to encourage timely business filing as well as discourage fraud by activity-triggered notifications, the state should deploy account management services as outlined in the MyAccount Dashboard section of Identifying Issues and Alternatives above.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Path 2: Proceed with review and improvements to the existing Kansas Business Center, as well as begin a project to reinvent KBC concepts and service delivery in line with the path above.</p>

<p>Further detail about this path is included in the Recommendations and Next Steps section that follows. Any efforts to implement a more integrated approach to state business formation and business type licensing and permitting should incorporate the concepts above, as well as those outlined in the Identifying Issues and Alternatives section of this document.</p>
