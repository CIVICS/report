<h3>Relationship between Success Metrics, Goals and Data-Driven Systems</h3>

<p>One important implication of adopting the Web 2.0 approach described in the proposed conceptual design described in this report is that it enables easy real-time reporting and automation potential for virtually all business interactions, legal processes and technical operations occurring on or with the Kansas Business Center.</p>

<p>This is because the architecture calls for careful deployment of &ldquo;flow event identifiers&rdquo; at key points across the system. Since the approach calls for an entirely data-driven and web 2.0 implementation, the interposition of standard system logging is not only possible but easily deployed in a uniform manner at all layers and dimensions of the system.  Whether a new business has been successfully formed, a server patch installed, a help desk inquiry answered or a user authorization to share data granted, the same type of flow event identifiers can be sensed, secured and stored.  Once stored in a standard format within a designated file or data-set, appropriate apps and services can easily be configured to notice, alert, refresh, push, pull, get, put or otherwise triggered to take expected actions.</p>

<p>The activity with external apps and services that are registered as clients with the KBC or to which the KBC is registered as a client would have Flow Event IDs sensing, creating, preserving and communicating activity with the KBC.  For example, each time a given app requested access to a protected Profile Attribute, an event would be logged not only to effectuate the first-order permission flow by the user, but also to feed real time management oversight, performance monitoring and later oversight and audit analysis.  In addition, the same Flow Event ID can and should be used to feed internal and partner business intelligence, market analysis and trend spotting analytics or in some cases could even trigger payment processes for cost share, revenue share or other consequent or second-order data-driven transactions.</p>
