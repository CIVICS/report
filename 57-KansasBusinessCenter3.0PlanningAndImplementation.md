## Kansas Business Center 3.0 Planning and Implementation

The second set of recommendations relate to the next steps required to plan and execute a successful reinvention of the Kansas Business Center, hereafter referred to as the “Kansas Business Center 3.0” project.  The “3.0” designation has a dual purpose – the first is to pay homage to the 2003 and 2008 versions that came before it. The second expresses an intent to leverage the innovative practices currently emerging nationally that superseded the Web 2.0/Gov 2.0 trends of the last decade by making use of RESTful web services, mashups, geomapping, federated identity, mobile first design, and other consumer technologies to extend to combine and extend government processes to interoperate seamlessly with the tasks and technologies used by citizens and businesses every day to accomplish their work.

These recommendations build upon the recommendations made in the previous section, as well as concepts from both the Key Use Cases and Requirements, and Identification and Evaluation of Alternatives sections to propose a roadmap for Kansas Business Center 3.0 implementation.

### Planning and Governance

The next steps assume that the State has agreed to establish a KBC steering committee.  If so, they should immediately proceed to implement Recommendation 2 & 3 above.  However, if the Steering Committee decides to move forward in preparation for a Kansas Business Center 3.0 project, the following planning and governance tasks should be performed.


### Recommendation B-1

Hire a project director to lead the Kansas Business Center 3.0 project.  

The INK Board should fund this position as an employee of INK, but have it report to the steering committee for the duration of the project.  This will not only publicly signal and reinforce INK as a significant stakeholder and joint sponsor of the project, but also create a bridge to integration of the new KBC technologies and processes into other 
INK applications.

Once the steering committee and Board have taken this step, the implementation of the inventory outlined in Recommendation 4 above should be built out to a create a more comprehensive picture of the “as-is” situation with business filing in the state.

### Recommendation B-3

Baseline selected key business registration and licensing transactions at the state.

To understand the cost-benefit and return-on-investment of process reengineering, as well as to factor in current levels of inconvenience and cost to businesses to prioritize functions for inclusion in the scope of a Kansas Business Center 3.0, it is necessary to establish “as-is” benchmarks for these processes.  How long does it take on average to form a business? Without measuring some aspects of the current environment, it will be difficult to ensure that the “real” problems are addressed, and to provide justification for the investment in significant changes.

Once executive leadership has a better view of both the opinions and experiences of current customers and the state of the most oft-used processes and systems for registration and licensing, the Steering Committee should weigh carefully the value of reengineering processes and streamlining of associated regulations to avoid “paving the cow path” by automating processes without revisiting their efficiency.  In this vein, the following recommendation should be considered optional based on policy, timing, the feedback of businesses, and other drivers in the current economic environment.

###Recommendation B-4

Convene a “Blue Ribbon Panel” on Streamlining Business Regulation

Considering the oft-cited complexity and opaque nature of some of these processes, it seems like it would be profitable to begin efforts to improve the Kansas Business Center by commissioning a review of these processes by some type of “blue-ribbon panel”, a joint group of private and public sector representatives who could offer recommendations for reengineering and streamlining them before further automation is attempted, if only within particular targeted categories. For examples, see the Oregon Regulatory Streamlining and Simplification Initiative at:

http://www.oregon.gov/COO/Pages/regulatory.aspx, the Washington State Auditor’s 2012 report on Regulatory Reform at
http://www.sao.wa.gov/auditreports/auditreportfiles/ar1008276.pdf, or the State of New Jersey Red Tape Review Commission (http://www.nj.gov/state/dos_red_tape.html).

Finally, while sponsorship and priority should be visible to state agencies and the public through the chartering of a steering committee and the accompanying outreach, the last recommendation in this section comes from our interviews with other states.

###Recommendation B-5

Pursue Business One-Stop Legislation and Executive Order. 

The INK Board should recommend that the Steering Committee advocate the introduction of legislation accompanied by an Executive Order as a clear signal of the desire for cooperation, focus, and responsiveness to business in the form of the Kansas Business Center 3.0 effort. While there is clearly interest in this project at executive levels today, all of the states interviewed took this step to clarify both expectations and sponsorship for the project.


Earlier in the Identification and Evaluation of Alternatives section of this report, the recommendation was to pursue two paths in parallel.  The first was to Deploy a Toolbox for Intergovernmental Business Registration and Filing. If the state is to embark on a KBC 3.0 project, the four elements of that strategy should be pursued from the outset. Proposed approaches for two items from that strategy deserve special mention here:

### Recommendation B-6

Implement Federated Identity as a Service. 

Approach INK to offer federated identity services for state agency business filers. As noted in the Strategic Context of this Initiative section earlier in this report, the state declared interest in a single sign-on solution for business as early as 2010, but that approach is not yet currently in place.

INK was created for the purpose of “routing around” bureaucracy and the long planning and implementation cycles of traditional government.  The Board can easily work with third party providers to create an identity offering that could be used to streamline interactions with business.  It is also possible that an existing credential, such as the username and password approach currently used by a popular business partner like the Kansas Department of Revenue or Department of Labor could be extended for this purpose. Whatever the approach, the implementation of federated identity could jumpstart innovation efforts in this and other areas of government service delivery.

### Recommendation B-7

Pursue account management functionality for use in business filing statewide.

It is not clear whether this could be developed as a freestanding service, in concert with federated ID, or as an extension of account management functionality currently in place at INK, or even that planned or used like the Kansas Department of Revenue.  However, as explained as part of a previous discussion, this type of functionality is sorely needed, and may be able to be built free-standing, whether or not a project to build some type of comprehensive integrated filing center is undertaken.


Until final decisions have been made on scope and agency participation, it is difficult to provide detailed cost and planning information for a KBC 3.0 project.  However, the execution phase of this project should follow the standard methodology for Information Technology projects in use at the State of Kansas.  To start, a project charter should be developed that includes a clear and commonly accepted scope. Efforts should be made to develop detailed requirements that incorporate the information outlined in this document.  In reviewing materials from other states, the State of Indiana Business One-Stop project appears to have many commonalities with the overall scope, if not the identical technical approach, as the State of Kansas, and this was confirmed by our conversation with them.  The Information Network of Kansas Board and those sponsors and agencies that will be associated with this project should review the project planning materials they have developed and make use of these artifacts in crafting an approach to the Kansas Business Center 3.0 project.
