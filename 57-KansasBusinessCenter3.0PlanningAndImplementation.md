## Kansas Business Center 3.0 Planning and Implementation

The second set of recommendations relate to the next steps required to plan and execute a successful reinvention of the Kansas Business Center, hereafter referred to as the “Kansas Business Center 3.0” project.  The “3.0” designation has a dual purpose – the first is to pay homage to the 2003 and 2008 versions that came before it. The second expresses an intent to leverage the innovative practices currently emerging nationally that superseded the Web 2.0/Gov 2.0 trends of the last decade by making use of RESTful web services, mashups, geomapping, federated identity, mobile first design, and other consumer technologies to extend to combine and extend government processes to interoperate seamlessly with the tasks and technologies used by citizens and businesses every day to accomplish their work.

These recommendations build upon the recommendations made in the previous section, as well as concepts from both the Key Use Cases and Requirements, and Identification and Evaluation of Alternatives sections to propose a roadmap for Kansas Business Center 3.0 implementation.
