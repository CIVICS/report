# Environmental Scan: Focus on Innovation

The following new factors and opportunities emerging in the broader environment can be leveraged directly or as design patterns for Kansas Business Center:

## Changing Environment

In today’s world, constant innovation in service delivery is a given. Nowhere is that more true than with technology. In the five years since the Kansas Business Center last underwent renovation (2008), a lot has happened.  Mobile technology is quickly removing to replace the standard desktop or laptop. The first Android-powered phone was released that fall, and the iPhone, released in 2007 would go on to sell millions handsets and transform the way citizens communicate. In turn, the first iPad didn’t appear until 2010, but sold at three times the rate of the iPhone per quarter. There was not yet a Bing, Instagram, or Pinterest.  Barriers to funding and entry to online startups have fallen (Kickstarter, Indiegogo). There is an increased focus on the value of data - Big Data and Open Data have become mainstream during this period, and now personal data (Quantified Self) is on its way to becoming the “new asset class” (Pentland, 2008).

With so many changes occurring in the private sector, and the increasing influence of consumer technology in shaping both business and government service delivery, it is important that the State adopt an approach that prizes flexibility and loosely-coupled technology that can fit in the growing “API economy”, where government technology works as a “platform” (O’Reilly, 2010) for innovation, allowing entrepreneurs to build on top of data and services to meet public needs. An approach focused on lightweight integration of systems and data sharing also opens up government for improved data-based policy making that improves efficiency and delivers more effective and responsive services.
This section of the report takes a look at several trends and technologies that should be considered by the Information Network of Kansas and its partners in deciding on both an approach to the next generation Kansas Business Center and to maintaining its lead as a government innovator.

##Trends and Technologies

###API Economy

The term API, or Application Programming Interface, has been in use for a number of years. API specifications standardize the way that software interoperates. And, increasingly, across system and organizational boundaries, allows different applications to make use of services and data, creating the potential to combine them in new ways to create new public/private services.  Private industry is rapidly adopting and incorporating Open APIs to innovate, and this effort is extending now to the federal government (see API directory at: http://www.data.gov/developers/page/developer-resources#individual and article “The Recent Rise of Government APIs at:  http://bit.ly/14gy14y).  

### Representational State Transfer (REST) interfaces are growing in adoption. Such “RESTful endpoints” allow data to be pulled by external applications to fuel re-presentation and combination of data.  One Kansas example is the Kansas Legislative Information System and Services (KLISS) application, winner of the 2012 National Association of Chief Information Officers Open Government (NASCIO) award.  The KLISS RESTian Interface Guide (v7.0, 2012) provides 50-pages of instructions and formats for entrepreneurs who would like to integrate this open data into their applications. There are many creative ways government information can be exposed and used – imagine the possibilities for the API released just this spring by the USDA that catalogs Farmer’s Markets: http://blogs.usda.gov/2013/05/15/new-api-helps-satisfy-the-nations-app-etite-for-farmers-markets/.

###Social Media and Networking

The huge growth in Social Media use by the public and government is not new, but growth in this area of innovation remains strong.  According to the Social Media Directory located on the state portal (http://www.kansas.gov/media-center/social-media/), over 30 state organizations participate in social media services like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.  While a cursory review appears to indicate they are mostly used for one-way posting of information, with some communication, the use of Social Media by government in Economic Development efforts like the Kansas Business Center seems like an area ripe for progress, where information about Kansas markets, economic development funding, commercial building sites and related services can converge into a platform that can support a forum for business interaction with government and community economic development resources. While to some extent this is currently being accomplished by Network Kansas, a tighter integration could be built and extended in this area.

### Social Log-in: Consumer-focused Federated Identity

The last three years has seen large gains in the use of “social” logins and identity – from social media sites, like Facebook, Twitter, or search engines like Google – as federated logins, with a single sign-on from one of these providers accepted across multiple websites.  While this technology is still maturing, the concept of social login has a myriad of potential uses – to enable simple tasks like signing up for notifications, to commenting on draft publications or providing feedback on government services.  Using technologies like OAuth2 and OpenID Connect can enable sharing of user attributes between sites that, in time, may be useful as a base for sharing user registration data across both public and private partners.   The idea of federated identity is being actively explored across government and industry: 

•	MyUSA (formerly MyGov). [http://presidential-innovation-fellows.github.io/mygov/ ] The federal government Presidential Innovation Fellows program (see more below), with a team member from the National Information Consortium (the Kansas Information Consortium’s parent company) recently demonstrated a MyUSA federated identity that could be used by citizens as a common login to share basic information across federal websites.

•	National Strategy for Trusted Identity in Cyberspace (NSTIC) and IDESG grants.  [http://www.nist.gov/nstic/] The federal government has implemented a national strategy for allowing the use of federated identity for interoperable credentials in the name of increased security and economic development.  The grant program is continuing to explore options through a pilot program, and federal agencies – such as the United States Postal Service – are pursuing novel approaches like the Federal Cloud Credential Exchange (FCCX) that would work across the federal government and private sector. While this is a complex area to navigate, the rewards of simplifying and standardizing credentials are great. 

The Identity Ecosystem Steering Group (IDESG) http://www.idecosystem.org/group/leadership  - a private sector group established by NSTIC to support the strategy - has a broad membership across industry and continues to work to expand the capabilities of federated identity technologies. As the Information Network of Kansas considers their role in enabling citizens to overcome the barrier of additional usernames and passwords (on average of 7 passwords across 25 websites per citizen - Florencio, D., & Herley, C., 2007) to ease government interaction, INK should actively explore these solutions for use with state government services and the Kansas Business Center. More information on this topic is included in the Next Steps and Recommendations and section of this report.

### Open Data

Across the world, there has been an explosion of interest in publishing government data in machine-readable format as an aid to accountability and economic development. A number of states have created sites along the lines of the federal Data.gov website (www.data.gov). The President recently issued an executive order titled “Making Machine Readable Data the New Default for Government Information” http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government- that reinforces this direction at the federal level.  Internationally, the Open Knowledge Foundation has created CKAN – Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network - http://ckan.org/) open source data portal software that can be used to host and deliver government open data. Software from private sector companies such as Socrata http://www.socrata.com/ are used by many jurisdictions to deliver open data. 

### Personal Data Service

The last few years has seen increasing concern related to privacy and reuse of personal data, as well as its potential as a “new asset class” (Pentland, 2008) that can improve efficiency and generate wealth. Commercial companies, such as MyDex (http://mydex.org/) and Personal (http://www.personal.com/) have risen up to provide secure individual data stores which can be used to hold and protect individual data, as well as to control rules for both active and passive submission and sharing of such data. While the technology and concepts are relatively new, they are already being tested by government (see http://mydex.org/prototype/whos-involved/).   

The MIT open source model for personal data services is called openPDS and is described at http://openpds.media.mit.edu.  Many more companies and public sector initiatives abound in this space as well.  The Personal Data Ecology Consortium (PDEC) provides a key venue for relevant organization that are innovating in this field.  More information on PDEC is available at: http://pde.cc 

###Predictive Analytics

The rise of “Big Data” has been accompanied by an emphasis on predictive analytics, that is, making use of data mining and statistical techniques to enhance planning, policy making, and responsiveness based on modeling of a wide swath of government service, including pattern detection in crime in general, fraud, and risk management. It can include matching resources invested in service delivery channels to planned volume and timing, or assist in identifying emerging problems in infrastructure, security, resource consumption, or health. In the case of the Kansas Business Center, patterns in activity can be mined. For example, the Indicators of the Kansas Economy application proposed by Kansas, Inc. in the 2007 Kansas Economic Development Strategic Plan identifies the needs for “a single source of objective and consistent information that allows public and private leadership, as well as all interested Kansans to better understand the economy and enhance decision-making capacity.”  (http://www.kansasinc.org/pubs/working/2007StrategicPlan.pdf)  Viewing potential Kansas Business Center analytics from this vantage point can help identify specific contributions that can be architected into a solution.

### Tech-enabled Civic (and Organizational) Engagement 

As part of the “Civic Startup” movement referenced below, a number of tools have come together to solicit “crowdsourced” forms of citizen input, attempting to take advantage of the Wisdom of Crowds (Surowiecki, 2004) – where science is showing that decisions or ideas that are developed through the aggregation of group input, rather than by individuals, are often more effective policy solutions.  Ideascale (www.ideascale.com) has been used successfully by the federal government, as well as by states to crowdsource idea generating and ranking for policy suggestions and potential alternative solutions to public challenges – Google Moderator (http://www.google.com/moderator/) allows the posting of questions and responses, where software like Crowdbrite (www.crowdbrite.com) supports collaborative brainstorming.  These types of approaches are growing in use in the municipal environment, but their applicability is broad, including internal to government, across governments, and with private or nonprofit partners. Wiki Government (Noveck, 2009) details how “looking beyond institutionalized centers of expertise” can help government be more innovative and productive in problem-solving and service delivery.  When looking for approaches to the Kansas Business Center (see Attachments), we engaged Dr. Noveck in identifying those sources, and this report is one result.

### Gamification

Gamification is a term used to refer to designing applications and services to mimic the incentives, interactive nature, and attention-getting aspects of gaming, but for idea solicitation and collaborative problem-solving in the public sector. Badges that can be collected and displayed online as a sign of participation or achievement are just one example. Participatory budgeting applications, where citizens can prioritize spending within the parameters of a set time period, tax revenue, etc. is another approach growing in popularity. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification for more information.
