### Comprehensive Analytic Base for Decisions

Several key areas of information that would be useful in the identification of existing issues and options for resolution related to the current Kansas Business Center, as well as in planning and goal setting for the Kansas Business Center 3.0, appear to be missing.  While the ability to translate this information into action is predicated on the establishment of formalized governance (see preceding recommendation), the following data points provide sample metrics that could be useful, along with examples of how they might be used:

Enhanced web traffic and site usage profiles.  Inbound link profile (what sites are linking in to the KBC; what the traffic interaction is, if any, between KBC and Network Kansas websites); Search terms being used to bring users to the site and by users on the site; Page abandonment (where users stop or leave the site) as well as shopping cart and related payment engine abandonment.  This information can be used to perform Search Engine Optimization (SEO) activities as well as improve the usability of the existing site and assist in planning for future efforts.

KBC Registered user profiles. Statistics on current KBC registered users in terms of activity (length of subscription (new this period vs. repeat), frequency of use, transaction profile); Number of Kansas.gov subscribers vs. total number of KBC users, and similar statistics as well as trends.  This information can be used to better understand user community and their behavior and level of use of current KBC as a baseline for improvement and incorporated in planning – and perhaps outreach – for a new Kansas Business Center.

Business Formation, Registration/Licensing statistics.  Integrated view of the relationship in levels of licensing activities at the two agencies that the KBC is a “feeder” for to understand what percent of licensing is driven by the KBC and associated trends, existing state and trends in electronic v. paper filing and related statistics.  Example use is to better understand current effectiveness, role, impact re: the Kansas Business Center as it relates to business formation transactions executed.

### Recommendation A-2

Establish Data-Driven Foundation for Assessing KBC Performance 

As part of advocacy for independent governance for the Kansas Business Center, the Information Network of Kansas Board should recommend and dedicate resources to supporting enhanced data analysis related to KBC traffic and transactions in line with the examples outlined above.
