<h3>Approaches</h3>

<h4>Hackathons and App Contests</h4>

<p>A get together, usually one day or over a weekend, of software developers for intensive team-oriented development of prototype applications around a particular problem or theme, with the resulting products usually open source, the best of which may gain life as a full development project by the sponsoring party. Recently, there have been a number of hackathons focused on government – for examples, see the National Day of Civic Hacking (http://hackforchange.org/), which included state government participants from Maryland, New York, and Nevada; the International Open Data Hackathon (http://opendataday.org/; and Apps for Communities (http://appsforcommunities.challengepost.com/.</p>

<h4>Idea contests</h4>

<p>There are a number of contests for ideas on how to solve public problems. This is a method that could be used to fuel brainstorming on innovative tools and techniques that could be of value in reinventing part or all of the Kansas Business Center (or the Information Network of Kansas).  One student-focused example with regard to Big Data/Open Data is the University of California at Berkeley’s Big Ideas contest (http://bigideas.berkeley.edu/contest/opendata/).  Kansas could look at partnering with local (Kauffman Foundation for Entrepreneurship, Kansas State, University of Kansas) or national (New York University, Knight Foundation) organizations to generate attention and ideas that may help shape the direction of technologies and techniques delivered in the new KBC.</p>

<h4>Kauffman Foundation</h4>

<p>The nearby Kaufmann Foundation is heavily invested in strategies to nuture the start up and entrepreneur communities.  Their Kauffman Labs for Enterprise Creation (http://www.entrepreneurship.org/en/Kauffman-Labs.aspx ) hosts innovative programs for entrepreneurs like 1 Million Cups (http://www.1millioncups.com/). INK could approach Kauffman to work together to attract public-sector focused startups to bring innovation to Kansas government.</p>

<h4>Knight Foundation</h4>

<p>This foundation has created an initiative called Tech for Engagement that is focused on funding projects focused on open government and civic engagement. Many of the projects they are interested in have connections to subjects within the scope of the Information Network of Kansas mission. See http://www.knightfoundation.org/funding-initiatives/tech-engagement/).</p>
