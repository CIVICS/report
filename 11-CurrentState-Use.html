<h2>Current State: Kansas Business Center (2.0)</h2>

<p>This section provides a high-level overview of the functions and governance of the current Kansas Business Center (referred to as v2.0), located online at: http://www.kansas.gov/businesscenter.</p>

<p>The functionality related to the Kansas Secretary of State’s office has been confirmed by them. The discussion of the Kansas Department of Revenue functionality is taken directly from a review of the site and has not been verified with their management. In addition, we did not conduct a technical review of the website, but relied on information provided from documentation created as part of a code review commissioned by the INK Board.</p>

<h3>Use</h3>

<p>Information about the current and historical usage of the Kansas Business Center website is provided below.</p>

<p>***Graph</p>

<p>Without further investigation of the scope and basis of the report – several additional statistical reports are provided with it – it is difficult to make definitive statements about the usage of the site. For example, on its face, it is not clear what has resulted in the lower numbers for 2013 – this could be a technical issue, for example. Overall, the traffic appears to be in the range of 20,000-50,000 page views per month since 2009, remaining relatively steady except for the more recent downturn.</p>

<p>Recommendations about analysis of Kansas Business Center website traffic and the potential value of enhanced analytics related to activity occurring on and in the environment of the site are provided in the Recommendations and Next Steps section of this report.</p>
