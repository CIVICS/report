<h1>About this report</h1>

<p>This document was prepared in response to Statement of Work v1.6, Proposal 3076 as modified June 14, 2013 titled “Creation/Validation of Conceptual Design Alternatives for the Kansas Business Center” and attachments (see Appendix A for copies). This document was prepared by Daniel “Dazza” Greenwood (Architect) as per Statement of Work v1.6, Proposal 3076 as executed June 28, 2013 titled “Creation/Validation of Conceptual Design Alternatives for the Kansas Business Center” and incorporates significant contributions by the INK appointed Points of Contact Duncan Friend and Kathy Sachs of the state of Kansas as a collaborative endeavor. The initial proposal to conduct this work was proffered on March 25th, 2013 and work on the project contributed by Architect prior to the effective contract date of June 28th, 2013 was provided on a voluntary basis pending confirmation of the formal scope, deliverables and mutual obligations. Contributions by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are independent and outside the scope of this engagement.</p>

<h2>Scope of Engagement and Recommendations</h2>

<p>The primary focus of this report is the Kansas Business Center. However, this work was originally commissioned by the INK Board with the purpose of investigating best practices, technologies and opportunities for reinvention of not just the Kansas Business Center, but the vision and strategy of the Information Network of Kansas itself. This is confirmed by the Board action reflected in their March 2013 meeting minutes authorizing funding to be used to engage “industry leaders to discuss best practices and assist the Board in developing its vision for the future of INK.” While the principles and technologies outlined in the report are focused primarily on the KBC, they are also directly relevant to a reinvention of the approaches used by the Information Network of Kansas. A summary of the work conducted during the development of this report with various industry experts as it relates to these goals, including discussions with Dr. Alex Pentland of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab and Dr. Beth Noveck, former Deputy Chief Information Technology Officer of the United States and currently founder and principal at New York University’s Wagner School of Public Service Governance Lab, is included in Appendix B. In addition, a section devoted to recommendations for how the Information Network of Kansas can increase their role in support of entrepreneurship and innovation in the delivery of government information and help fuel greater economic development in the State of Kansas is included in the Recommendations and Next Steps section of this report.</p>
