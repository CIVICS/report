## Usability Improvements

As documented earlier in this report, a cursory review of the existing Kansas Business Center interface suggests that there are opportunities for improvement.  Such improvements are likely to come at a relatively low cost, and should establish a usability baseline against which to judge improvements (see recommendation for “data-driven foundation” above) and also produce data from new and existing customers that can be incorporated in the vision for the future Kansas Business Center. 

### Recommendation A-3

Perform user-testing on the existing Kansas Business Center website, along with related agency applications.
The Information Network of Kansas Board of Directors should invest in independent user testing of the existing Kansas Business Center and those applications that are currently integrated with it, with the intent of identifying “quick hit” improvements and collecting data that can be used to inform planning for the future KBC.
