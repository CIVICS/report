#### Planning and Governance

The next steps assume that the State has agreed to establish a KBC steering committee and begun implementing the recommendations outlined in the preceding section. Once Recommendation A-4 has been completed and reviewed, this inventory should be build out to create a more comprehensive picture of the “as-is” situation with business filing in the state. 

#### Recommendations B-1

Establish an E-Business Inventory. 

Fund the creation of an inventory of primary systems involved in business licensing across cabinet agencies with the idea of identifying “low hanging fruit” – processes and technical capabilities where incentives exist for “quick hits” in removing roadblocks and increasing access and usability. As discussed previously, automation of bulk filing should be a priority, as for many intermediaries, a website could be much less useful than creating the ability to file in bulk electronically.


#### Recommendation B-2

Baseline selected key business registration and licensing transactions at the state.

To understand the cost-benefit and return-on-investment of process reengineering, as well as to factor in current levels of inconvenience and cost to businesses to prioritize functions for inclusion in the scope of a Kansas Business Center 3.0, it is necessary to establish “as-is” benchmarks for these processes.  How long does it take on average to form a business? Without measuring some aspects of the current environment, it will be difficult to ensure that the “real” problems are addressed, and to provide justification for the investment in significant changes.

Once executive leadership has a better view of both the opinions and experiences of current customers and the state of the most oft-used processes and systems for registration and licensing, the Steering Committee should weigh carefully the value of reengineering processes and streamlining of associated regulations to avoid “paving the cow path” by automating processes without revisiting their efficiency.  In this vein, the following recommendation should be considered optional based on policy, timing, the feedback of businesses, and other drivers in the current economic environment.

#### Recommendation B-3

Convene a “Blue Ribbon Panel” on Streamlining Business Regulation

Considering the oft-cited complexity and opaque nature of some of these processes, it seems like it would be profitable to begin efforts to improve the Kansas Business Center by commissioning a review of these processes by some type of “blue-ribbon panel”, a joint group of private and public sector representatives who could offer recommendations for reengineering and streamlining them before further automation is attempted, if only within particular targeted categories. For examples, see the Oregon Regulatory Streamlining and Simplification Initiative at:

http://www.oregon.gov/COO/Pages/regulatory.aspx, the Washington State Auditor’s 2012 report on Regulatory Reform at
http://www.sao.wa.gov/auditreports/auditreportfiles/ar1008276.pdf, or the State of New Jersey Red Tape Review Commission (http://www.nj.gov/state/dos_red_tape.html).

Finally, while sponsorship and priority should be visible to state agencies and the public through the chartering of a steering committee and the accompanying outreach, the last recommendation in this section comes from our interviews with other states.

#### Recommendation B-4

Pursue Business One-Stop Legislation and Executive Order. 

The INK Board should recommend that the Steering Committee advocate the introduction of legislation accompanied by an Executive Order as a clear signal of the desire for cooperation, focus, and responsiveness to business in the form of the Kansas Business Center 3.0 effort. While there is clearly interest in this project at executive levels today, all of the states interviewed took this step to clarify both expectations and sponsorship for the project.
