#State Government Goals

Because the Kansas Business Center has existed in some form for over ten years, it has likely been discussed in a number of settings and included in various planning documents that support technology and business initiatives at the State.  The following excerpts provide the most recent thread of statements about its purpose and planned improvements in technology planning documents available online:

Requirements/Design Efforts: 2009-2010

Efforts were made in the 2009-2010 timeframe to realize goals in the state’s 2008 Strategic Information Management (SIM) plan that pertain to the KBC, resulting in a set of high-level architectural diagrams for a proposed expansion of the KBC and a grant proposal to the Board, dated November 30, 2010, for this work . It is not clear whether or not that proposal was submitted to the INK Board. Copies of this material are provided in Appendix C.

The next revisiting of the Kansas Business Center in State IT goals and planning documents appears to be as an outcome of an IT consolidation feasibility study completed in October 2010. The following excerpts related to the KBC are taken from that report.

The most recent state IT planning document - 25 Information Technology Initiatives to Lower IT Costs or Improve State IT Efficiency - does not devote a specific initiative to the Kansas Business Center. However, it outlines an effort to create a common platform for automation of licensing and registration processes that would support the KBC.
