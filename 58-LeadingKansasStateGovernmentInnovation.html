<h2>Leading Kansas State Government Innovation</h2>

<p>INK has spent the past two years focused on the “back office”.  While a primary source of growth has been the expansion of KanPay Counter applications to schools and local government, as well as on issues around performance, administration of grant funds, and the composition of credit card charges, these initiatives do not position INK as a leader, nor provide the kind of energy and leadership – the “spirit of INK” – that has won the board national recognition in the past.  While increasing the utility of information may manifest itself in a move to “mobile first”, to the degree that this is simply reconfiguring or reinventing the delivery of previous services, these efforts appear – from the outside at least – to lack the spark of innovation evidenced in the kinds of projects and organizations outlined in the Environmental Scan: Focus On Innovation section above.</p>
