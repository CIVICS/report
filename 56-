## Integrated Planning and Coordination

In general, recommending a focus on short-term improvements to the existing KBC comes from an acknowledgement that the current site and related agency applications are currently in use and that a project to replace them cannot be completed overnight.  On a similar note, it also seems likely that new initiatives targeted at business customers are poised in either the planning stages or are in some stage of development.  Visibility into the current state of those projects will be required for, the new Kansas Business Center governance committee to accurately assess the appropriate role and level of short-term investment in the current KBC as it relates to these initiatives, as well as offer guidance and coordination on timing and approach for their participation of sponsoring agencies in the new Kansas Business Center.

Most efforts in other states point to this step as an early key to success.
