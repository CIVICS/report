<h2>History and Strategic Context</h2>

<p>To identify opportunities for innovation in the service delivery model for the Kansas Business Center (KBC), we begin by tracing the current mission of the KBC to its foundation in the strategic goals established by both the Information Network of Kansas Board of Directors and the State of Kansas. We then place recent efforts toward improvement in that context, and consider what might be needed to successfully engage innovation. The following review should not be considered comprehensive, but provides excerpts from key documents that convey the history and purpose of the KBC as it relates to strategy and commitments to improvements.</p>

<h3>Mission of the Kansas Business Center</h3>

<p>The Kansas Business Center was initially deployed online in December 2002. The KBC was redeployed with a new interface and capabilities on December 22, 2008. The website referred to in this report is currently located at: http://www.kansas.gov/businesscenter/.</p>

<p>The mission/purpose of the Kansas Business Center has been referred to in at least two ways over time.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In a 2003 nomination for recognition by the National Association of State Chief Information Officers (NASCIO) Digital Government award in the Government-to-Business category, it is described as a “one-stop business resource for state government.” This characterization is especially relevant as this nomination was submitted by the Information Network of Kansas and, thus, constituted its public vision at that time.</p></li>
<li><p>In a June 2009 announcement in the Network Kansas monthly newsletter, the lead article refers to the KBC as “the official online state resource for information, filings, and personal assistance to start or maintain a Kansas business.” This mirrors the statement of purpose located on the current home page of the KBC website and will be considered definitive as the current Mission Statement for this report.</p></li>
</ul>
