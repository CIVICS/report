<h3>Align with and Sponsor Progress on Statutory Initiatives</h3>

<p>The last set of recommendations expanding innovation involves tighter integration with existing Kansas initiatives.  While some of these ideas are embodied in the previous sections, they deserve separate emphasis and focus for the Board. All have received legislative support and provide unique opportunities for innovation and support the mission of INK.</p>

<h3>Recommendation C-6</h3>

<p>The Information Network of Kansas Board should convene jointly over a series of meetings with representatives from each community represented by the following innovative Kansas initiatives with the goal of better understanding opportunities for long-term partnership and investment:</p>

<p>Kansas One Map Act
Kansas Taxpayer Transparency Act
Kansas Enterprise Electronic Preservation project</p>

<p>At a minimum, the Board should make an ongoing commitment to investment in the GIS Innovation Fellow position, the creation and support of ongoing efforts to expand the amount and kind of data delivered on data.kansas.gov, and commit to tighter integration of Open Data efforts with the Kansas Electronic Enterprise Preservation initiative making the State of Kansas a leader in making Kansas heritage and “long data” sets tracking changes over time in economic development, legislation and regulations, transportation and other types of data available to its citizens to increase transparency, accountability, and to spur innovation.</p>

<h3>Kansas OneMap Act</h3>

<p>(See Appendix I for legislation and planning material)</p>

<p> The 2012 Kansas OneMap Act (HB 2175) presents an excellent opportunity for investment and full-scale support by the INK Board.  While the Act envisions a unified approach to the creation and use of mapping data across the state, it has the potential to revolutionize the capacity of the state to deliver meaningful information that increases the quality of life of citizens and make Kansas more competitive in the national economy.  The salient portion of the Act reads as follows:</p>

<p>Sec. 5. The board shall:
(a) Establish public and private partnerships throughout Kansas to maximize value, minimize cost and avoid redundant activities in the development and implementation of geographic information systems;
(b) foster efficient and secure methods for data sharing at all levels of government;
&copy; coordinate, review and provide recommendations on geographic information systems programs and investments and provide assistance with dispute resolution among geographic systems partners;
(d) continue to establish Kansas’ leadership role in the national effort to improve capabilities for sharing geographic information and ideas with other states;
(e) promote the use of geographic information systems technologies as tools to break through structural and administrative boundaries to collaborate on shared problems and enhance information analysis and decision-making processes within all levels of government;</p>

<h3>Kansas Taxpayer Transparency Act</h3>

<p>This 2008 Act (HB 2368) created a Public Finance Transparency Board (See http://www.kansas.gov/KanView/hb2368.html) to oversee a website that displayed public financial data. The website was originally constructed and hosted on INK.  The legislation was a first step toward the type of transparency and open data delivery anticipated in INK’s enabling statutes.  However, the legislation is slated to expire on June 30, 2014. (See Appendix J)</p>

<p>This legislation provides a unique opportunity for the INK Board to take a leadership position, in partnership with the Governor’s office and Secretary of Administration in driving the integration and expansion of this function of government.  The legislation was sponsored by a longtime supporter of INK, Rep. Jim Morrison, who has previously recognized by the Board for his contributions to and support of the INK Mission.
While the Board has not convened in the last several years, its structure and membership is composed in a way that makes it well-suited to collaboration on INK initiatives:
(1) The secretary of administration or the secretary’s designee, who shall serve as  chairperson of the board;
(2) the director of accounts and reports or the director’s designee;
(3) two members who are chief executive officers of agencies of the executive branch or such officer’s designees, appointed by the governor, who shall serve at the pleasure of the governor;
(4) four members of the general public, two appointed by the governor, one appointed by the president of the senate and one appointed by the speaker of the house;
(5) four members of the legislature, one appointed by the president of the senate, one appointed by the minority leader of the senate, one appointed by the speaker of the house, and one appointed by the minority leader of the house, all of whom shall serve at the pleasure of the appointing official;
(6) the legislative post auditor or such auditor’s designee;
(7) the state archivist or such archivist’s designee;</p>

<p>Like the OneMap Act, this legislation also provides for advice on new types of data and directs state agencies to cooperate – an approach that supports the INK mission directly – as shown in the following:</p>

<p>“After implementation of the initial website, the public finance transparency board shall advise the secretary of administration on incorporating additional information described by this act from any other source of information available to the secretary of administration including information submitted by state agencies pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. (d) Any state agency shall provide, at the request of the secretary of administration, such information as is necessary to accomplish the purposes of this act.”</p>

<p>The INK Board should consider ways in which it might raise awareness and advocate for the continuation of the Kansas Taxpayer Transparency Act beyond its June 2014 sunset, as well as collaborate with the Department of Administration to integrate it into ongoing efforts to create and support data.kansas.gov.</p>

<h3>Kansas Enterprise Electronic Preservation</h3>

<p>(http://keep.ks.gov/)</p>

<p>HB2195 (2011), now K.S.A 45-414, grants the Kansas State Archivist, along with the State Records Board, the authority to establish standards for maintaining the authenticity of government records in Kansas. In a companion project, INK, along with the Library of Congress, funded the creation of a trusted digital repository for Kansas State records of enduring value.  As the Information Network of Kansas Board demonstrates leadership through the initiatives outlined above, they should continue to invest in and create stronger partnership with the Kansas State Historical Society and the Kansas Enterprise Electronic Preservation function of state government.</p>

<p>The state archivist’s statutory authority for authenticating electronic records, coupled with the experience information science, metadata, electronic cataloging and service delivery to the public make him and the state archives unique partners for the Information Network of Kansas.  However, an investment in a continuing partnership can bring more benefits to INK.  As continued fiscal pressure is exerted on state and local government, the KEEP repository provides a ready resource to take over custody of open records that have enduring value to the public.  As information and documents move more to standardized data formats, it is the Kansas State Historical Society that will build the large collections of data that the public, business, and researchers will be interested in. For policy development, longitudinal data collected over time can be of great help in understanding and predicting demographic and economic trends. Our state’s history, cast through a geospatial lens, will be invaluable in better preparing for resource allocation challenges, public safety, and researchers in natural resources, transportation, and even health. The Kansas State Historical Society is in the “information business” and should be considered a foundational partner in INK initiatives.</p>
