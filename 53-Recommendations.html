<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>This section incorporates suggestions made earlier in the report, as well as those created as an outcome of the analysis.  The recommendations are organized into three main areas as follows:</p>

<p>Improvements to the existing Kansas Business Center</p>

<p>The current KBC is operational. Regardless of the approach chosen for going forward, opportunities are available to improve the site with minimal time and effort.</p>

<p>Planning and Implementation for an Improved Kansas Business Center “3.0”</p>

<p>These are the bulk of the recommendations, incorporating the opportunities for innovation previously identified and a set of actions to jump start the process to govern, plan, implement and maintain an improved Kansas Business Center.</p>

<p>Information Network of Kansas Support for Innovation and Entrepreneurship</p>

<p>The innovative public-private partnership first introduced in Kansas was intended to provide flexibility in investments and approach to delivering government services and information.  These recommendations offer new ways to take advantage of current national trends in innovation that can also feed economic development efforts and attract entrepreneurship around the Kansas Business Center and related initiatives.</p>

<p>Each area proposes a set of actions that could be taken immediately to advance the effort, as well as a roadmap for the mid- to long-term.</p>
