<h4>State of Washington</h4>

<p>The State of Washington has made several attempts at developing a Business One-Stop and their current project is in the startup phase.  In the last legislative session, they requested an appropriation for the project (over $8M) in the most recent legislative session that was not approved.  As a consequence, they are likely to proceed with a more incremental approach going forward. However, it is not yet clear specifically what options – or their associated costs – will be pursued. The State CIO’s office is charged by Executive Order 12-01 (January 2012) and by statute (SB 5718), with leading and reporting on the effort.  In testimony this spring, a proponent stated that there were 1,377 licenses, inspections, and permits needed to form and conduct the full range of businesses in the state.</p>

<p>The current effort is just now underway, so some of the characterizations made in the interview were informal and involved “thinking out loud” on future direction. A prototype has been created and was recently demonstrated to a steering committee that has been established. Washington, too, has contacted other states to learn more about the approaches being used.  From this survey, they found wide variation, from large, expensive projects that attempted to achieve the One-Stop vision of full integration that “knows who you are” and takes  a user through the entire business formation and licensing process, to sites that consisted predominantly of inventories of hyperlinks to other websites.</p>

<p>In their effort, there remain questions about what data will stay at their Department of Revenue or Secretary of State’s office, and what will “live in the middle tier”.  The concept would be for there to be some type of shared business profile, with a shared authentication system, while the authorization levels for specific access reside in the individual agency systems.  An outline of the general project approach is included in the November 2012 report titled “MyAccount - Streamlining Business Transactions with Government” (See Appendix F and http://www.ofm.wa.gov/ocio/documents/MyAccount_report.pdf?).
This report is an outcome of a requirement in the Governors Executive Order cited above for the state CIO to “collaborate with the agencies and small business community to develop a high-level enterprise architecture design and implementation plan for an integrated online system by September 30, 2012” (later extended to November 15, 2012).</p>

<p>The 15-page report, developed over 10 months in partnership with eight state agencies, recommends a phased approach. The recommended governance would be led by the Department of Revenue with an executive sponsor from the Governor’s office assigned to “remove roadblocks and hold the lead and other participating agencies accountable for making regular progress.” In the original (not fully funded) plan, Phase 1 involves implementation of “MyAccount”, a common platform/backbone that enables single sign-on.  The process would run concurrently with upgrade projects on existing systems and agencies would be “loosely coupled” to the backbone. A portal with a shared business profile would also be part of this first phase. The agencies to be included were the core agencies for business formation, along with a consolidated licensing agency (Business Licensing Service).  This phase of the project was estimated to cost $7-$8M and be operational in three years (2015).</p>

<p>Phase 2 of the project was to upgrade and modernize existing core systems – in this case, two major areas, Business Licensing and Department of Labor and Industry, along with improvements to the Business Portal and the Secretary of State’s Corporate Registration process, with an overall estimated completion in 2015 at a combined cost of $14-$15M. Phase 3 is stated somewhat indefinitely and involves expanding the services to include “additional jurisdictions and business activities” to include localities and broader permitting, as well as mobile access.</p>

<p>From our discussion with a representative of the State of Washington’s CIO office, it appears that the state already has in place a statewide authentication service based on IBM Tivoli. Most of the “tenant” agencies participate in this, except for the BLS, who will be upgrading to the most recent version. Also, the state has had in place what they term a “Universal Business Identifier” for a number of years – a common number used to refer to a business across agencies and consider this a necessary piece to achieve success. There is some question about the potential to make use of North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes in the system to identify the specific nature of the participating businesses as well in ways that could drive the provision of additional information and services. They are still looking at potential software solutions, and there are questions about whether or not some agencies may even require a sign-on from the user.  At this point, it appears that an agile, incremental approach to build-out is going to be most successful. They observed that a content management system may be an integral part of the solution, noting the capabilities of several open source systems (Joomla, Drupal) and that the approach will likely be structured to support a distributed approach to content management related to the site where agencies manage their own. Finally, from a project administration vantage point, they have set up a collaborative SharePoint site to share documents and status about the project and feel it has been very helpful given the distributed nature of the parties involved in the project.  At the end of the conversation, they expressed interest in creating some type of best practice (and perhaps code) -sharing group across states who are involved in these efforts, given that some are just starting, and others appear to be at the stage where they are ready to go through a first round of upgrade.</p>
