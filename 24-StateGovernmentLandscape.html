<h3>State Government Landscape</h3>

<p>The efforts undertaken by the State of Kansas to improve the ease the startup and filing processes for businesses mirror similarly focused efforts at the state-level nationally. While a comprehensive review of the status and success of these projects is beyond the scope of this report, this section provides a brief look at some of the approaches that other states have taken. The information comes primarily from two sources:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Interviews conducted by staff from the Kansas Secretary of State’s office (and, discussion held earlier this spring, with representation from the Kansas Office of Information Technology Services) with other states who deployed or are currently in the process of deploying solutions with a similar focus to that of the Kansas Business Center.</p></li>
<li><p>A cursory review of other state business portals and supporting materials that can be found online, including reports and project planning documents that provide insight into their efforts.  Especially helpful was an appendix from a December 2011 report produced by the Commonwealth of the Kentucky titled “Innovation in Government: The Kentucky One-Stop Business Portal Assessment” (http://onestop.ky.gov/SiteCollectionDocuments/Kentucky%20Business%20One%20Stop%20Portal%20Final%20Assessment.pdf) is included in Appendix E.  The appendix in the Kentucky report “Appendix D: Inventory of States – Websites” was characterized in that report as follows:</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The below chart details an exercise by the Kentucky Business One Stop website team where they reviewed all state’s website and determined if the state had a Business One Stop website, its operability and available components. Based on this analysis, Kentucky is now one of twelve states with a functional Business One Stop website.</p>

<p>While this work should not be considered definitive, it does provide a convenient listing of the sites that were identified at that time that could be used by the INK Board or the state in conducting further analysis.  The report also contains another appendix, “Appendix G: Technical Survey of States with a Business One Stop Service”, which catalogs more detailed information about technical aspects of three one-stop projects in Ohio, Michigan, and Virginia.  We reviewed this survey as part of our analysis and used it as a partial basis for the questions used in interviews conducted in the step that follows.</p>
