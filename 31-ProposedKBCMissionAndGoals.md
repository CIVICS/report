###Proposed Kansas Business Center Mission and Goals

The principal goals of the Kansas Business Center should be:

To enable entrepreneurs to easily identify and quickly complete the filings necessary to form a business in Kansas. 

Once formed, to allow businesses to refer to a single source to maintain and access their filings with the State.

To increase the accuracy, while reducing data entry, complexity and processing time for the submission of business filings to the State.

To improve the openness, sharing, and reuse of data about business activity in support of policy making and to further economic development. 

To integrate payment processing and account management for these transactions
