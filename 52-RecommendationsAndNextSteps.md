##Recommendations and Next Steps

###Next Steps

We propose that the INK Board use this Report’s research finding and proposed conceptual design approach as an input to deliberation and decision on next steps for the Kansas Business Center.  This Report should also be used to garner feedback from key stakeholders to validate or revise the assumptions and recommendations.  Active engagement with and testing of the recommended technologies and solutions identified in this draft is recommended.  

Review and feedback by the INK Board regarding the vision, goals and objectives for KBC is essential to confirm or establish a shared view.  In addition, Kansas agencies and counties as well as other local, state or federal agencies may have valuable comments and, selectively, their feedback should be solicited. 

Specifically, we recommend that the INK Board:

1)    Consider the content of the Report and share question, comments or ideas an input to organize a Board Meeting agenda item on this topic;

2)    Host a stakeholder facilitated workshop to stimulate dialog and feedback on the desired direction for Kansas Business Center;

The introductory section titled “About this Report” includes an excerpt from the INK Board meeting minutes stating that one of the purposes of this effort is to “engage industry leaders to discuss best practices and assist the Board in developing its vision for the future of INK.”  While the primary focus of the recommendations in this section is the Kansas Business Center, they also address how the Information Network of Kansas Board might take advantage of opportunities for innovation that support their mission, while also attracting entrepreneurial interest in their work that could also benefit the Kansas Business Center and its ultimate goal of improving the business climate in the state.
