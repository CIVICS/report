<h3>Establishing Use Cases, Requirements, and Constraints</h3>

<p>Establishing detailed requirements, constraints and use cases intended to drive the software code development, integration or configuration of specific technologies is beyond the scope of this Report.  However, such detailed decision are necessary at the appropriate moment in the process of re-design for the Kansas Business Center and should be preceded by and aligned with the INK Boardâ€™s eventual determination of vision, purpose and goals for the Kansas Business Center.  The detailed use cases must also reflect and support a process of negotiated consensus building among all the key stakeholders that will depend upon, operate or otherwise significantly impact or be impacted by the system.  Chief among these stakeholders are the Kansas businesses that the system is primarily intended to benefit and second the agencies, departments and other organs of government that will interoperate with and through the system.   The detailed functionality for Kansas Business Center improvements and specific requirements from other state agencies or local units of Kansas government is not, therefore, intended to be part of this conceptual design.  See the Next Steps and Recommendations section of this report for recommendations on further work to be done in this area.</p>
