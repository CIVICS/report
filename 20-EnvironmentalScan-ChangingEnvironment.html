<h2>Environmental Scan: Focus on Innovation</h2>

<h3>Changing Environment</h3>

<p>In today’s world, constant innovation in service delivery is a given. Nowhere is that more true than with technology. In the five years since the Kansas Business Center last underwent renovation (2008), a lot has happened.  Mobile technology is quickly removing to replace the standard desktop or laptop. The first Android-powered phone was released that fall, and the iPhone, released in 2007 would go on to sell millions handsets and transform the way citizens communicate. In turn, the first iPad didn’t appear until 2010, but sold at three times the rate of the iPhone per quarter. There was not yet a Bing, Instagram, or Pinterest.  Barriers to funding and entry to online startups have fallen (Kickstarter, Indiegogo). There is an increased focus on the value of data - Big Data and Open Data have become mainstream during this period, and now personal data (Quantified Self) is on its way to becoming the “new asset class” (Pentland, 2008).</p>

<p>With so many changes occurring in the private sector, and the increasing influence of consumer technology in shaping both business and government service delivery, it is important that the State adopt an approach that prizes flexibility and loosely-coupled technology that can fit in the growing “API economy”, where government technology works as a “platform” (O’Reilly, 2010) for innovation, allowing entrepreneurs to build on top of data and services to meet public needs. An approach focused on lightweight integration of systems and data sharing also opens up government for improved data-based policy making that improves efficiency and delivers more effective and responsive services.
This section of the report takes a look at several trends and technologies that should be considered by the Information Network of Kansas and its partners in deciding on both an approach to the next generation Kansas Business Center and to maintaining its lead as a government innovator.</p>
