<h2>Begin with the End in Mind: Establishing the Mission and Success Metrics</h2>

<p>The INK Board and potentially any stakeholder steering group it may develop to help steward re-design of the Kansas Business Center must establish the authoritative vision, mission, goals and objectives that will guide architecture and operations going forward.</p>

<p>At a very high level of abstraction, the mission of the Kansas Business Center is impliedly to reduce the obstacles or needless time required for a new business to form in Kansas.  But below that generic policy aim, there are an array of implicit and potentially different assumptions about the intended mission, goals and objectives for the effort.  While the recommended general direction and conceptual design approach described in this report is of general merit, it cannot substitute for governance processes, executive judgment, and decision-making about the destination, path and speed of progress expected.  The business practices and models, legal and policy rules as well as the technical or operational processes should explicitly reflect and support success and achievement as defined by the decision makers.</p>

<p>Whether the vision, goals and technical solutions approach proposed by this Report are ratified in their entirely, in part or totally replaced with a fresh approach, the most important outcome is that the intended purposes and outcomes for Kansas Business Center be discussed, deliberated and clearly decided.  Based upon an agreed high level vision and path, the ultimate selection of methods and mechanisms to achieve the outcomes can be conclusively evaluated and decided.  However, the process of exploring and reporting upon high value innovating opportunities now available for use by Kansas Business Center has resulted in a rich set of options for consideration by the decision makers.</p>

<p>As an outgrowth of the analysis performed as part of the environmental scan that is summarized in this report, the team developed a set of proposed goals for the Kansas Business Center.  Next, they developed a set of principles that represent best practices and general criteria that can be used to evaluate options for improvement of the Kansas Business Center in line with those goals.  The following summary of these Goals and Decision-Making Principles are offered to provide a starting point for the governance and executive management process recommended by this Report.</p>
