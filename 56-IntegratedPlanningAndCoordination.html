<h2>Integrated Planning and Coordination</h2>

<p>In general, recommending a focus on short-term improvements to the existing KBC comes from an acknowledgement that the current site and related agency applications are currently in use and that a project to replace them cannot be completed overnight.  On a similar note, it also seems likely that new initiatives targeted at business customers are poised in either the planning stages or are in some stage of development.  Visibility into the current state of those projects will be required for, the new Kansas Business Center governance committee to accurately assess the appropriate role and level of short-term investment in the current KBC as it relates to these initiatives, as well as offer guidance and coordination on timing and approach for their participation of sponsoring agencies in the new Kansas Business Center.</p>

<h3>Recommendation A-4</h3>

<p>Create an inventory of current state business-facing initiatives with an online component that are presently in the planning or implementation stages.</p>

<p>The inventory and associated discussions with agency executives would be used by the KBC steering committee in establishing a unified vision and roadmap for Kansas Business Center 3.0, as well as making timing and staging decisions to set common expectations and ensure a coordinated implementation of the vision.</p>

<p>Finally, the initial revisiting of the existing Kansas Business Center can provide vital information about the appropriate scope and approach for reinvention efforts. The final recommendation in this section seeks to obtain advice from where it matters most:</p>

<h3>Recommendation A-5</h3>

<p>Incorporate the Voice of the Customer in Shaping the Vision</p>

<p>As part of implementing the recommendations above, reach out to the business community to identify roadblocks to business registration and filing, as well as opportunities for closer integration that can be incorporated in the scope of the KBC 3.0 project. Most efforts in other states point to this step as an early key to success.</p>
