###Interviews with Other States

The size and complexity of the scope for business registration and filing projects varies across states, as does the cost, duration, and approaches to development and implementation.  Therefore, by definition, this selection is not comprehensive.  In addition, each state environment has many unique dimensions. Examples include: 

The size and diversity of the business community and economic climate; 
legislative interest, support, and available funding;
the strategic emphasis placed on the effort by the Governor and other elected officials; 
the sophistication of the state’s technology environment and resources available from competing projects; and
the history and relative success of the efforts in this area made to-date. 

Therefore, without a deep study of each project, lessons can only truly be learned at a high-level and the primary focus of this exercise was considered by the team to be one of sizing the appropriate project scope and developing some understanding of the potential resources (people, technology, funding) required and the risks involved, as well as where innovation might be occurring.

The four states that were interviewed directly were Nevada, Oregon, Indiana, and Washington.  The list below provides a general outline of the type of questions asked during the interviews, followed by sections summarizing the information obtained:

Questions

How was the project sponsored/led?  
How is governance for the project, and for ongoing operations, handled?  
What did the effort cost overall (estimated)? – internal and external (and, if external, which vendors/pieces)  
What is was the length of project and how was it phased?  
Was the software solution custom built, commercial off-the-shelf, or a combination?  
How did you handle any procurements – like, one big one to start (package with consulting) or serially?  
How is maintenance and support for the solution handled (contracted or in-house?) What are the costs associated with that (estimated)?  
Method of integration/degree of integration of processes between agencies, if any?  Like, did agencies redesign/reengineer processes to participate, and, if so, to what degree?  
How is Identity handled? (Single sign on, federated identity, other?)  
Analytics / Information “Exhaust” (analytics, reporting and byproducts) – Open Data, Data Reuse (if any)  
What advice do you have in terms of Lessons Learned/Issues/Challenges  
Future plans/current related initiative – what are you planning or working on now re: one-stop initiatives?  
How satisfied would you say your customers were?  
What kind of transaction volume does your website have?  
For those services that are offered, are they also offered on paper/offline?  
What kind of increase have you seen in online adoption in those services with the advent of the new one-stop website?  
How do you support the site/services?  That is, are questions handled by a third-party, a central help desk, by agencies on who are responsible for a particular type of transaction, etc.?  
Are the costs of this support included in the costs discussed previously?
