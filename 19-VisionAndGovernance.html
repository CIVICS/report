<h3>Vision and Governance</h3>

<p>The focus could be on governance, the goals for the site and its performance against documented expectations.  While not “visible” on the site, the website and its functionality should be an outgrowth of this foundation and it is important that the operation of the KBC be tightly coupled to its sponsorship and both strategic and operational vision. This would include measures used to inform decisions.</p>

<p>In examining these perspectives to approaching the Kansas Business Center, it becomes obvious that any evaluation will be severely impaired by the lack of an established framework for evaluation.  What is the Kansas Business Center supposed to do?  What is the desired scope and roadmap for its achievement?  What are its annual goals for use, for expansion, for customer satisfaction?  While the current site represents itself as “The official online state resource for information, filings, and personal assistance to start or maintain a Kansas business”, there does not appear to be a set of ongoing goals and metrics against which its success is measured. This situation is not improved by the general nature of the goals outlined in either the state or INK strategic plans for the KBC that were surveyed earlier in this report.</p>

<p>Lacking specific metrics against which to assess the performance of the existing KBC, the following high-level analysis takes a mixed approach, drawing from those frames outlined above where the work can be accomplished with a limited investment of resources and possible opportunities for improvement identified.  In turn, the Recommendations and Next Steps section of this report provides a base set of suggestions on direction for the formal mission and success metrics for the next-generation Kansas Business Center.</p>

<p>As noted in the earlier section titled Strategic Context of This Initiative, the Kansas Business Center is mentioned periodically in both Information Network of Kansas and both state IT and business planning documents.  There is also evidence that a group of stakeholders were convened in the 2009-2010 period to investigate possible improvements in the KBC.  However, as it stands today, it appears that there is no formal guiding framework established under which the KBC is operating, no stakeholder-based governance committee, nor are there specific goals or metrics associated with its performance, and, in turn, no dedicated resources and or level of priority established across agencies that would result in their achievement.</p>

<p>The lack of formal governance made up of key stakeholders, along with ongoing goal setting and monitoring progress against success metrics is a significant challenge to further improvement of the KBC.  For example, the Commonwealth of Kentucky’s effort to improve their business one-stop involved the creation – by statute - of a Portal Advisory Committee with representatives from a number of cabinet agencies key to economic development in the state, chaired by representative from the Secretary of State and Governor’s office.  In the State of Washington, the Governor signed legislation that required the creation of a business one-stop collaboratively by six agencies which included a requirement for to establish performance benchmarks and to create a plan that would how they would “collaborate with the business community in order to receive business feedback and use business recommendations in the development of the one-stop business portal” and provide regular reporting on ways in which that has occurred (State of Washington, Chapter 31, 2013 Laws 2nd Special Session). There are many examples in other state one-stop projects of ongoing oversight and planning for such efforts that appears to be lacking in Kansas at this time. (See Appendix D for examples.)</p>

<p>Based on the material made available, this also manifests itself in reporting deficiencies. While the web traffic reports provide some high-level measures of activity, there does not appear to be any ongoing, consolidated, and readily available set of reports tracking the number of registered users, or the overall level of business filing. And, of course, without formal goals developed in relation to (and making use of input from) target audiences, nor a business case documenting measurable return on investment to either the state or business community, it would be difficult to evaluate the meaning of these types of metrics and whether or not they represented adequate progress.</p>

<p>Another challenge presented by lack of consolidated stakeholder-based governance is the lack of a process or venue for coordination of online service delivery efforts.  From available documentation, it appears that the Department of Labor has an online portal that allows for UI determination and a number of other filing functions apart from the KBC, and that the Department of Revenue is in the planning stages of a  “Virtual Tax Center” that might also be free-standing separately from the KBC.  The potential for integration of these efforts, or the efficiencies to be achieved from a user perspective, is unknown, but a mechanism for planning and coordination of such efforts with the larger Kansas Business Center strategy appears to be missing.</p>

<p>See Recommendations and Next Steps section for further suggestions in this area.</p>
