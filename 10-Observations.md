#Observations

When recent activities in support of the improvement of the Kansas Business Center are set in the context of the history of planning and goal-setting efforts by both the State and the Information Network of Kansas, several aspects stand out:

* There has been a long-standing publicly stated purpose to provide a one-stop location online for new and existing businesses to conduct all their interactions with the State. This was most recently re-emphasized in two meetings with the Governor and with his cabinet in fall 2011.  

* Despite recurring statements of this intent and some efforts at exploring possibilities in the period 2009-2010 and recently in the form of this report, the Kansas Business Center has not significantly expanded scope or technology in the last five years. Starts and stops of this nature are not unusual in business one-stop efforts as one can see from the state interviews included later in this report.

* There appear to be questions throughout this two-year period on the approach to be used, with directions seemingly set toward one vendor (Iron Data), then later another (System Automation), and, most recently, interest in a potential MIT solution has been discussed, along with potential solutions from EMC and Perceptive Software.

* The importance of a statewide identity management solution in support of a “collaborative business portal” was recommended as part of an IT consolidation study completed in October 2010.  However, the Information Technology Identity Management Group (ITIMG) does not appear to have been formally charged with this initiative, nor does any action in direct support of this goal appear to have occurred.

* Expansion/improvement of the KBC is not shown as a goal in current state planning documents.  At present, no stakeholder groups appear to have been convened, nor has any formally developed business case or itemized budget for any further development been constructed. Records show that there was $160,000 budgeted for the KBC in the 2012 INK Business Plan and $500,000 in the 2013 INK Business Plan.

Specific actions related to the challenges the state is facing in planning and execution in this area are included in the Recommendations and Next Steps section of this report.
