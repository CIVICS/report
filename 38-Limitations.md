###Limitations

While the vision of a fully digital business center is compelling, the evolution to a comprehensively web 2.0 public enterprise must be a process rather than an event.  Cultural change, testing, piloting, migration, stabilization, maintenance, sustainability, iteration and resilience to surprising events requires a period of time measured in years, not months.  Change management to accomplish responsible staging and phasing of deep innovation while ensuring business and user operational continuity of service is challenging.  Furthermore, the rest of the state of Kansas and the world will take time to change as well, but the Kansas Business Center must support users and partners with a wide range of technical prowess against a background of evolving technologies.  

In the context of data-driven success metrics, not all outcomes are capable of assessment solely from the data generated by or available through the KBC or any single system.  Relevant data and other measurable information both from the KBC system itself and also from other relevant sources will be needed in some instances in order to evaluate whether a goal or objective has been achieved.  Certain external systems would provide ready sources of relevant data in the same manner as the KBC system precisely through the REST based interfaces employed to interoperate with the KBC via Web 2.0 approach proposed.  For instance, activity with integrated apps and services can and should have Flow Event IDs associated with all key interactions - especially those involving user permissions or core business transactions.  Most data within or at in/out touch points between the KBC and external systems would not require Flow Event IDs because regular logging and deep detailed reporting would be sufficient to maintain a record if future review is needed but no real time actions or visibility are important.  

In most cases, the majority of activity in external systems will be inaccessible to parties governing or managing the KBC and business relationships or contracts will be needed to ensure some level of reporting or notification of key information over time. Examples could include anything from survey data on how system account holders incorporate their KBC data into other parts of business to backend transactional or performance data by third party app and service providers allowed to offer an interface to the KBC transactions.  The current state of reporting by external parties is typically not provided as an online automated service in a data-driven manner allowing real-time business, legal and technical processes or automation.  While there are significant advantaged to seeking a fully web 2.0 footing for the KBC it is important to note that much key data and business intelligence will source from external systems of varying quality, in varying types and by varying methods.  Even more importantly, the individual users of the Kansas Business Center have a wide range of technical and legal starting points and will it require time, information, and educations to become familiar with this approach.
