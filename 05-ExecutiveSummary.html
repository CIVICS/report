 <h1>Executive Summary</h1>

<p>In the world of business, time is money. The ability for entrepreneurs to act quickly on new ideas or plans is vital to a vibrant economy. For existing businesses, competition requires a focus on adding value while lowering costs. In both cases, reducing the time and effort required to interact with government is key to a growth promoting environment.</p>

<p>In lowering the barriers to business filing in the state, technology can play a key role.  Early on, electronic data interchange standards revolutionized the payment industry. Web-based filing followed shortly thereafter, where cumbersome paper-based processes moved online.  Now, a combination of electronic filing, third-party intermediaries, and web services are poised to change things again. In each case, the focus was on efficiency, and doing business in a way that made sense to business, leveraging the technologies used in the private sector to make interaction as seamless as possible while reducing costs in time and resources for both industry and government.</p>

<p>The Kansas Business Center (KBC) website was established in 2002 as a “one-stop business resource for state government”.  Ahead of its time, it provided a central, online location for use in meeting some of the requirements necessary to form a business in Kansas, along with links to general information about the process and the availability of services and organizations that could be of help.  Over the last ten years, however, efforts to expand the scope of the KBC have had mixed results.  The most recent version of the KBC (2.0) went live in 2008, and, while an improvement, the features remain similar to those available in late 2002, and efforts since that time to plan and deliver additional functionality have not been successful.  Other states have had similar problems, a collision of:</p>

<ul>
<li>The sheer number of occupations and industries, and related license types (in Kansas, over 350), in which the state is involved</li>
<li>The diversity of capabilities and competing priorities across the agencies that support them,</li>
<li>Business processes, each in different stages of automation, broken up across multiple organizations or divisions (including local and federal partners)</li>
<li>A lack of integration of the supporting systems, systems that are aging, varying in technology and complexity, costly to modify or replace, and</li>
<li>The absence of consensus or leadership with regard to the scope or appropriate cost of the project, the technical solution, or the roadmap to get there.</li>
</ul>


<p>It is in this environment that, early in 2013, representatives of the Kansas Secretary of State’s office met with the Governor’s office to discuss the need for reinvention of the Kansas Business Center.  As an anchor tenant that sits at the core of state business formation and filing, the Secretary of State agreed to lead a joint effort to improve delivery of the state’s business services, and the INK Board offered to support the work by setting aside $500,000 in funding. In March 2013, it was determined that ten percent of this amount would be invested in identifying new technologies and approaches that could bring current private sector innovation to bear on the project, as well as help the Board in preparing for the future. This report is a first step in that effort.</p>

<p><strong><em>Kansas Business Center: Opportunities for Innovation</em></strong> traces the history of the efforts around the KBC website and applications, placing them in the context of both the state strategies for business and technology and those of the Information Network of Kansas Board. The report identifies some challenges the state faces in planning, governance, and sponsorship in this area and includes recommendations to address them. It examines the current KBC website and offers an assessment of potential areas for improvement. Most importantly, it outlines the results of an investigation into new options for innovative approaches to the delivery of services that will ensure that future efforts are designed in flexible and forward-looking manner in anticipation of trends in technology, collaboration, and decentralized service delivery that are changing the way that both the private sector and government do business.</p>

<p>This report provides recommendations for an approach to reinventing the Kansas Business Center that the State can get started on right away. The recommended technical approach relies on web services to allow disparate systems to talk, and lightweight federated identity management that allows a user to be recognized by multiple agencies. It recommends sharing a common set of business data, architected in a way that can later scale, and common account management and payment methods that will allow users to create a dashboard to achieve a consolidated view of business activity.  The value of information collected and generated during these processes is also recognized, and the report recommends this value be consciously leveraged and “designed in” to any future approach.  Finally, recommendations are included that address how the burgeoning innovation culture evident in the “Gov 3.0” effort of citizen engagement and open government might be integrated more fully into the Information Network of Kansas model in ways that help them in their mission to</p>

<blockquote><p>“…explore ways and means of expanding the amount and kind of public information provided, increasing the utility of the public information provided and the form in which provided, expanding the base of users who access such public information.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The most important change in this approach to the Kansas Business Center is a change in philosophy. These recommendations envision a template-based KBC “suite of services” that are implemented incrementally across state agencies, services that incorporate private sector trends and technologies, versus a monolithic one-stop approach with the accompanying large investment of time and money on an ongoing basis.  While they may be deployed in one setting, such services can be combined and delivered in other venues, as parts of other offerings. This idea of doing business “where you are” online is a powerful re-conception of electronic government, in line with the new distributed nature of web services, decentralized delivery, and the increasing appreciate for the value of data in driving better both policy-making and economic development. We hope that this is a philosophy the INK Board can get behind, and look forward to the revolution to come.</p>
