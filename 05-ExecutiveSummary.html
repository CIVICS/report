<a name="preface" class="anchor" href="#preface"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Preface</h1>

<p>The Kansas Business Center is envisioned as an efficient, effective and elegant single touch-point for interactions and transactions between Kansas state government and Kansas businesses. The underlying logic is that by rendering all such interactions through coordinated information networks and electronic transactions it is possible to organize clear and easily available interaction points between business and state government.</p>

<h1>
<a name="drivers-and-inhibitors" class="anchor" href="#drivers-and-inhibitors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Drivers and Inhibitors</h1>

<p>The key drivers propelling this vision are promoting economic development, providing a superior business environment in Kansas and realizing intended outcomes of the statutory framework undergirding Information Network of Kansas. Although it is possible to design, build and operate a one-stop-shop for business interactions with state government, to date no government is known to have succeeded in achieving this popular aim yet. Major inhibitors to realizing the vision have included the continuation of paper-based touch-points between business and government, the lack of a common state enterprise architecture or approach to interactions with private entities and therefore a continual lack of business, legal or technical interoperability of government systems or common interfaces with external parties.</p>

<p>State governments have frequently attempted to consolidate under a single web site many or all tax, corporate and other regulatory filings with businesses under their jurisdiction. This consolidation leads to a website that is experienced like a portal or a hub which can become complex and confusing as additional agencies, services, transactions and other features are added.</p>

<p>A key success metric for such a portal is to have as many interactions as possible available through and operating under its common umbrella. Yet, as more types and methods of interaction are brought under the umbrella the portal becomes more complex and confusing for the users. The types of business to government interactions vary widely and in many cases it is infeasible to conform these interactions to a common user experience due to basic operational, policy, technical, economic, legal and other factors. Meanwhile, users must learn or discover how to find and navigate through the unique user account set up, particular organization of content, presumed site paths and supported workflow transactions and other idiosyncratic design and operation approaches for each state or participating state agency. While the customary portal and hub approach is helpful to the extent it presents and facilitates multiple business interactions in a more discoverable and accessible manner, the design concept also has major limits.</p>

<p>If all state government interactions with businesses could be re-designed from scratch, potentially the interposing of a unified portal with a dense hub could overcome many of the otherwise intractable issues resulting from attempting to force heterogeneous user experiences and flows through a consolidated site. Similarly, if all 50 state governments could be re-designed from scratch, then the inevitable discontinuity faced by businesses that interact with multiple states would be solved. To finally complete the intended business experience of a single face of government re-designing all states would need to be accompanied by re-designing all city, town, country, regional and other sub-state departments so the local layer of regulation and interaction would also conform to the same standards. And, of course, all federal agencies would need to comply with the local standards as well. Or would it be faster to attempt all state and local websites to comply with a federal standard… some time after such a standard comes into existence? Given the actual business, legal, technical and cultural contexts applicable to government business centers, the typical hub and portal approach may not be a good fit, to put it mildly. It would be more realistic to predict nothing like the above harmonization of government processes will happen for generations ñ if at all.</p>

<p>The common experience of web users - on big, medium or small screens alike - is how simple permissions enable many sites, apps and services to connect with each other and with you in the same way. Organizations using this user-centered web 2.0 approach have somehow found a way to integrate themselves together so we, as users, can authorize our content, interactions and identity to be easily shared and used across otherwise totally different systems. The same button that can allow us to login to thousands of sites with our social and email accounts also enables us to grant one site access to our photos on another site, and our location from our phone and calendar, tweets, profiles, etc. In fact, the same button can be employed to allow us to grant any app or service permission to access any information resources of ours from any other system. This characteristic of the web 2.0 ìOAuth 2î technology is the key to solution.</p>

<p>By use of the simple yet powerful design patterns of Web 2.0 online identity for user managed access to protected data, the Kansas Business Center and any governmental business center can overcome key business model and design challenges inhibiting achievement of potential and full value to all the stakeholders.</p>

<p>The Kansas Business Center is not different whether in vision, drivers or inhibitors, from the general context described above. The same types of seemingly interminable factors have likewise blocked more complete transition to a digital footing in healthcare, education, commerce, sciences, transportation and other sectors. However, key constraints to progress have recently been overcome in so-called ìWeb 2.0î environments by use of new business capabilities, legal methods and technical tools in particular design patterns. National governments including the United Kingdom and New Zealand have following the lead of the CIO and CTO of the United States in exploring how these capabilities, methods and tools can be applied in a government context. Leading academic and research thought leaders at the MIT Media Lab and NYU GovLab have likewise made strides in demonstrative tailored proofs of concept and collecting examples of practical deployments of these approaches by, with and between governments.</p>

<p>One game changer is the REST web applications interfaces, allowing widely distributed and heterogeneous systems to use simple common messaging and touch point interaction protocols, enabling ultra lightweight interoperation. Another game change is OAuth 2 with OpenID, enabling large distributed and heterogeneous populations of users to log into the same system with their native identity credentials and conversely allows any given user to log into a wide variety of different organizations with the same identity credential they always use. These mass-market capabilities are blended informally or according to the OpenID Connect standard to allow fine grained user-granted authorizations to protected data as well as simplified connections to many apps, services or other systems. And big data is a game changer opening deep insight but is now easily accessible thanks to solutions like CKAN, MongoDB and other open data tools.</p>

<p>Working closely with the Kansas Business Center Team, Duncan Friend and I have researched, analyzed and developed an approach and plan that INK can adopt and adapt to help achieve the full potential of Kansas Business Center. This approach is premised on a key set of innovative business practices, legal/policy instrument and technology/information tools and processes that embrace and focus available innovations.</p>

<p>The process of creating this report has itself been an act of innovation, new value-creation and generation of new knowledge. While the approach designed for the Kansas Business center has been uniquely tailored for this environment, the basic design pattern and value propositions are suitable for consideration by any government seeking to make the most of its business interfaces. Hopefully, the practices being explored and developed by Kansas can set a model and method for broader public sector innovation in the same way the statute enabling INK itself served as a national example soon followed by many states.</p>

<p>These game changers and their corresponding design patterns alter the fundamental dynamics that have defined the boundary conditions and capability set of Kansas Business Center. By testing the operational functions, features and flows of ìGov 2.0î with Kansas Business Center, the INK Board may well discover that this scalable, lightweight and robust approach holds the promise of a renewed period of invention, innovation and ingenuity not witnessed since the early days of the world wide web.</p>
