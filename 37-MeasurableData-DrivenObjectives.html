<h3>Measurable Data-Driven Objectives</h3>

<p>Consider the potential for data-driven design when a key objective is articulated like this: &ldquo;Reduce Complexity, Time and Cost of New Business Formation&rdquo;.  The measure of this example objective is ultimately about the reduction of &ldquo;frictions&rdquo; or &ldquo;impediments&rdquo; slowing down formation of new business and it is stated in a form that anticipates the kinds of data-sets, types of data services and particular data sources needed to compute achievement of the objective.</p>

<p>The criteria used for this example objective would relate to comparative analysis between a new KBC system and a prior KBC system or perhaps a comparison with a system of one or more other states in order to benchmark the extent to which the KBC system reduced factors identified as holding back new business formation.</p>

<p>The data acquired should be sufficiently relevant and regularized and refined to establish one way or the other if the KBC produced each of the identified intended results.  Reduction of complexity negatively impacting users could potentially be measured by direct data such as calculating the respective number options displayed on the user interface by each system respectively, or the respective number of steps in a process needed to complete an action or the respective number of sessions abandoned prior to completion of an active task.   Reduction of time needed to form a new business could be measured by the respective total active session times needed to complete the initial business formation alone and augmented to show views of the total elapsed time in days/hours/minutes from the initiation of the new business formation task until the task completion, including inactive session time during which the user had saved a partially completed form or paused an open process to be continued at later times.  Similarly, the amount of time reduction could be measured based upon the time a user completes all required state government interactions in order to open the business to the public, potentially including tax, licensing, permits and other approvals, notices or disclosures.  To the extent the related agency processes could be consolidated, accelerated or otherwise facilitated by the KBC system, reductions in time needed to form a new business could be demonstrated.  Reduction of costs could also be measured in a number of direct and indirect ways based on data available from or to the KBC.</p>

<p>One can easily see how once some consensus around clear goals and objectives supporting the vision and purposes for the KBC are established, it is possible to greatly increase the adaptive power of a Web 2.0 data driven systems design by describing the requisite goals, objectives and outcomes in data and service friendly ways.  In this way, it is possible to view the vision and outcomes on a kind of map and to use relevant data-sets, apps and services as sensors, propulsion and navigation of the KBC system toward its intended destination.  While most of the factors and information sources related to goals and objectives for public sector systems are not available easily or at all in an appropriate data-driven mode or accessibly by service oriented networked methods, nonetheless the business community is generally far ahead of state governments.  In particular, if KBC were to re-establish itself as a data-intensive and web 2.0 service friendly system then the expression of goals and objectives as computable values will be both possible and highly advisable for those contexts where the intended outcomes are easily and naturally available already.</p>

<p>Not long after a KBC system is established as data-driven components in a dynamic networked environment, the people and processes comprising governance and management of the KBC will becomes more familiar with, competent at and fluent about the operation, maintenance and iterative evolution of these types of systems. In fact, the operation of a REST based service for OAuth2 capable apps and services is not rocket science.  This is a design pattern successfully fueling a vast number of apps and services owned, operated and updated daily by teenagers, people starting web 2.0 businesses during nights and weekends and innumerable garage and living room ventures.  The overlay of production grade and government adapted processes and procedures can and should be less complicated than the manner of overlay of the same methods with past operational environments.</p>

<p>Once there is a minimum competency with the flows and functions of the type of data-driven architecture being proposed for KBC, it will be increasingly possible not only to formulate ever more goals and objectives as computationally expressible algorithms and analytics but also to start to describe higher level Purposes and Vision as well.  The example of a goal presented earlier - &ldquo;Reduce Complexity, Time and Cost of New Business Formation&rdquo; - demonstrated how data-driven processes can be designed as automated success metrics.  Consider the following high level outline demonstrating how the same basic approach can be used as part of a more comprehensive set of goals that are each themselves tied to higher level vision and outcomes as well as mutually supportive of other related goals:</p>

<p>Vision: Support and Enhance the Business Environment of Kansas With Kansas Business Center
Outcome: Utilize Funding and Authority of INK Statute to Innovate Kansas Business Center
Outcome: Utilize Redesigned KBC to Promote a Vibrant Innovation Economy for Kansas</p>

<p>Goal 1: Promote New Business Formation
Objective 1.A Reduce Complexity, Time and Cost of  New Business Formation
Objective 1.B Increase Access to Resources for New Business Formation
Objective 1.C Reward Data, Apps and Services Using KBC to Promote New Business Formation</p>

<p>Goal 2. Enhance Value of Ongoing Business Interactions With State Government
Objective 2.A Align INK and KBC Incentives and Success Metrics With Vision and Goals
Objective 2.B Reduce Duplicative, Manual and Optional Administrative Interaction
Objective 2.C Amplify Business Capabilities and Intelligence With Real-Time Open Data</p>

<p>Goal 3. Catalyze Expansion, Innovation &amp; Capital Formation for Kansas Businesses
Objective 3.A Enable Strategic Use of Information Technology By and For Business
Objective 3.B Amplify Value of State Business Data to Promote Innovation and Expansion
Objective 3.C Leverage Public/Private Partnership to Catalyze Capital Investment</p>

<p>The same approach used with business goals and objectives with data-driven metrics postulated above can also be applied to the legal and technical aspects of the Kansas Business Center.  To ensure the legal and technical aspects properly support and reflect the business requirements and constraints that decision makers will expect of a redesigned KBC, corresponding goals, objectives and supporting relevant data-sets and criteria are needed to define success metrics for the electronic and automated legal agreements and system rules as well as for the technical standards, available system functionality and developer resources needed to achieve the overall vision and outcomes desired.  By aligning, harmonizing and integrating the business, legal and technical goals, objectives and literal rules and online processes the future redesigned Kansas Business Center can be a fully data-driven, completely networked and widely distributed, massively scalable and profoundly interoperable model of next generation online government.</p>
