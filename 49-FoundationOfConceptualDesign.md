###Foundation of Conceptual Design

As a result of the research and investigation conducted to create this report, the following top items have been identified as an achievable yet high value synthesis of available innovation and capabilities.  The following three key architectural underpinnings can unlock the method and mechanism to achieve the full potential of the Kansas Business Center: 

#####1. Identity Driven Personalization and Convenience

#####a) Automatic Account Creation and Re-Use from Existing User Identity Credentials
This capability allows a user to create a new KBC account by granting authorization to populate the relevant fields with relevant data from their existing accounts with services such as a Google Business Apps account.  The same design pattern enables KBC users to authorize access to identity attributes such as their name, email address, physical address and other identifiers or attributes.  This can be used to greatly simplify, speed up and improve accuracy for the form filling aspects of business reporting and filings with government agencies accomplished through Kansas Business Center.  

#####b) Binding Many Identifiers and Logins to KBC Account 
This capability allows a user to bind externally provision identity credentials and tokens from services such as Google, Yahoo or LinkedIn to their KBC account in order to login and also provides a way to collect and manage additional identifiers such as license, permit or registration numbers.  These attributes, like the other identity-related attributes mentioned above, can also be shared via automatic processes to facilitate the access to and use of key sets of business identifiers across a myriad of state agency transactions.

#####Future-State: From User Identity Federation to Business Identity Services
In the future, this capability can serve as the basis for providing a wide array of business identity services including anti-phishing services allowing other entities and consumers to confirm a given web site is in fact that of a given business and also to assist businesses to prove their identity or to authorize access to authoritative identification or authorizations by state agencies to conduct activities.  

#####2. Data Driven Management and Operations 

#####a) Protected Data Authorization Services
This capability allows an agency to request and a user to grant authorization to access protected data to, for example, auto-populate a form.

#####b) Big Data Access Services
This capability allows access to aggregate data sets by Kansas agencies with oversight, evaluation or enforcement responsibilities and also enables “open data” access by members of the public, researchers, economic analysts and others seeking to work with aggregate business center public data.

#####Future-State: From Data-Driven Services to Predictive and Analytics Services
Advanced analytics for big data business intelligence and predictive modeling can be the largest source of value and revenue for a future Kansas Business Center if this proposed design pattern is adopted.  The “derived data” used for this type of analysis is at least once removed from personally identifiable data and direct individual data and hence can be anonymized, aggregated to shared with third parties based upon end-user permissions or revenue sharing models.  Business intelligence based on data is key to the future of the economy and of business in the digital age.

#####3. Rules Driven Governance and Adaptation

#####a) Standard Interfaces and Data Structures for Easy Upgrade or Replacement
This capability refers to the use of REST and other interfaces and the JSON or other corresponding data structures that are defined and made available by Kansas Business Center as a service provider.  This is a foundation of an architecture for rules-driven and performance metric based all-digital public enterprises of the future.  

#####b) Standard system rules and agreements for all users, agencies and third parties
The business, legal and technical integrated systems rules and trust frameworks ensure all parties, systems and interactions occur under predictable legal and policy structures.  

#####Future-State: From OAuth Scopes and Rules to Real-Time Service Optimization and Pricing 
Ensuring data-driven transactions comply with governance and management rules is essential to the integrity and success of a web 2.0 enterprise – especially in the public sector.  The nature of the technologies and design patterns proposed is inherently founded upon permissions, authorizations and explicit rules governing and enforcing access and transaction flow decisions.  The audit and oversight information sources to ensure performance and compliance is therefore also a unique capability of these cross-platform web 2.0 approaches.
