###Proposed Decision-making Principles

In evaluating the alternative proposed in the following section, the solution approach selected should:
Implement functionality that supports business registration, filing, payments, and ongoing reporting in a way that is as seamless as possible to the end user, so that it: 

Minimizes or eliminates the need for the user to re-enter data across systems and agencies
“Remembers” the user across organizational boundaries and time
Allows users access to their own data, as well as exercise fine-grained controls on sharing with both the state and, over time, other parties they choose.
Amplifies the value of the business identity established as more transactions are conducted
Incorporates lessons learned and capabilities for ongoing assistance to businesses by Network Kansas.
Integrate with a common payment system for business registration filing and reporting activities with the State.

Use a technical solution that accommodates the integration of backend agency processes and systems in a way that:

Minimizes up-front investment and ongoing cost
Is standards-based
Is secure
Is stable, scalable, and minimizes technical risks in implementation and support
Uses a framework of configurable “components” that are reusable and extensible to new processes and agencies
Allows changes in processes or requirements to be easily implemented and maintained.
Makes use of open source technology, where appropriate, carefully weighing the cost/benefit of “open code” with the advantages of commercial off-the-shelf software packages and third party hosting that can reduce the complexity and resources required for maintenance.
New agencies or processes can be added and integrated over time without significant rework, risks.
Focuses on reducing redundancy and complexity in the current electronic process.

Design the user experience in such a way that:

Mirrors best practices across public and commercial applications
Portrays transitions across organizational boundaries in government as seamless, both horizontally and vertically
Leverages private and public sector best practices and incorporates the functionality desired by intermediaries who file and maintain records on behalf of business owners in both batch and individual mode.
