<h3>Take Ownership and Drive Innovative Projects</h3>

<p>The current INK Grant program, while successful, lacks a concerted focus on innovation, and appears have a reactive (vs. proactive) posture in seeking opportunities for investment.  Rather than focusing on innovation, the following grant evaluation criteria:</p>

<p>Increase Citizen/Business Access
Align to State Initiatives
Expand Portal Information
Improve Access Technologies
Revenue Generation
Market Adoption
Integrated Services
Extensible (reusable) design</p>

<p>See http://www.kansas.gov/board/INK_Grants/index.html</p>

<p>seem more oriented to a government policy and procedure manual than the playbook of a public-private information entrepreneur.  The word innovation, in fact, does not appear in the INK Grant Procedures and Guidelines document.</p>

<p>Outside-In Approach to Government Innovation</p>

<p>The Information Network of Kansas Board should take an “Outside-In” approach to innovation and focus on incentivizing external parties and entrepreneurs, in the spirit of INK, to bring “in” new ideas to Kansas government to both solve problems and unlock information for reuse and third-party innovation.</p>

<p>While the grant process should be structured to remain flexible to reserve the capacity to invest in late-breaking or unplanned projects, the Board should immediately move to reorient the focus of their investments as outlined in the following recommendations.</p>

<h3>Recommendation 3</h3>

<p>Take a leadership and ownership role in creating and hosting a data.kansas.gov website to host Open Data sets, making available state assets to seed economic development, accountability and transparency efforts. This work should involve a partnership that incorporates data scheduling and cataloging efforts already in place by the Kansas State Historical Society (KEEP, KSPACE) and the Department of Administration (KanView).</p>

<h3>Recommendation 4</h3>

<p>As part of fulfilling its mission to expand access to government information and development of the data.kansas.gov site, the Information Network of Kansas should lead and support efforts to integrate the functionality of a public register called for in K.S.A. 45-221 (emphasis added):</p>

<p>45-221. Certain records not required to be open; separation of open and closed information required; statistics and records over 70 years old open. [See Revisor&rsquo;s Note] (a) Except to the extent disclosure is otherwise required by law, a public agency shall not be required to disclose:</p>

<p>(16)   Software programs for electronic data processing and documentation thereof, but each public agency shall maintain a register, open to the public that describes:
      (A)   The information which the agency maintains on computer facilities; and
      (B)   the form in which the information can be made available using existing computer programs.</p>

<p>Such a register has never been created.  Not only is it an opportunity for INK to take a leadership role in open access to information, but the material gained from research contributing to its creation will be of valuable in fulfilling INK’s mission, and create a resource that can be leveraged by state agencies for data sharing and efficiency purposes.</p>

<p>For several reasons, INK is uniquely positioned to lead this effort and the most appropriate party to do so.  First, the INK vehicle was designed to expand access to information and increase its utility for the public.  The organization was specifically created outside the bounds of traditional government bureaucracy to approach their mission entrepreneurially and quickly, bringing private sector attention and innovation to bear.  Next, the current network manager who can provide assistance in these efforts, has unique financial incentives to tap their national network of over 26 states, as well as corporate resources to invest in prospecting for new and innovative uses for government data and to connect that to third party community to spur economic development and enhanced services to citizens.  Finally, current state IT efforts are focused primarily on internal efficiencies and cost reduction. The state lacks an inventory of open data and the resources to either compile one or deploy the technology infrastructure required to spark discussion and innovation in this area. See already existing sites in Illinois (data.illinois.gov), California (data.ca.gov), Colorado (Colorado.gov/data/), Iowa (data.iowas.gov), Oregon (data.oregon.gov), Washington (data.wa.gov), and others.</p>

<p>For data.kansas.gov efforts to achieve optimum value, the Information Network of Kansas should invest in stimulating discussion and innovation around Open Data.  The following recommendations align with this goal and have the added benefit of attracting interest and opportunities for collaboration to discussions about increasing innovation in the INK model. The INK Executive Director should be charged with pursuing these initiatives at the direction of the INK Innovation Committee.</p>

<h3>Recommendation C-5</h3>

<p>The INK Board should take a primary leadership role in fostering conversations about the value of Open Data and information generally in economic development, transparency, and government efficiency in the State of Kansas. The initial efforts should be coordinated by the Innovation Committee and focus on three approaches:</p>

<p>• Data and Democracy Symposium and Lecture Series. Sponsor and convene a symposium on Data, Development, and Democracy that brings together thought leaders in e-Government, e-Democracy, and Open Data with business, political leaders, and entrepreneurs to explore ways in which government information can serve as a platform to remove government obstacles to innovation, spur economic development, and increase civic engagement in the political process, along with improving government efficiency and policy outcomes.
• Open Data Business Plan competition. Sponsor, in collaboration with Network Kansas, Kauffman Labs, and other Kansas institutions focused on economic development and entrepreneurship, the Information Network of Kansas Open Data Business Plan competition. The competition should have two components. The first incentivizes startups and entrepreneurs to explore sources of government data and potential uses for economic development and civic good.  The second focuses on the policy issues around potential uses of government open data (privacy, security, etc). Expertise from big data researchers at MIT Media Lab, NYU’s Governance Lab project, and policy experts from Kansas academic institutions should be involved in shaping the competition to ensure the information gained will be used to advance understanding and dialog on these issues among citizens, business, and government.
• Geospatial Innovation Fellows program.  As outlined in the section that follows, geospatial information technology has tremendous capabilities to expand services available to Kansas citizen and businesses, increase the understanding of both policy gaps and impacts, and spur innovation and economic development.  The Information Network of Kansas board should begin a pilot program to sponsor individuals from the private sector, academia, and government to raise awareness of innovative uses of geospatial technology to increase the economic competitiveness of Kansas and the quality of life of Kansas citizens through demonstration projects that leverage Kansas’ position as a national leader in this area. This program can be overseen by both public and private experts and organizations, along with entrepreneurs and civic leaders convened by INK who can identify opportunities to address pressing problems and emerging opportunities in our state.</p>
