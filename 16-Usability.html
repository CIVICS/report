<h3>Usability</h3>

<p>In the previous section, a high-level catalog of the primary functions available through the site is provided and this could be used to perform usability tests with potential audiences for the site to determine areas where navigation could be improved (see http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/usability-testing.html). This effort could be coupled with analysis of the routes individual users are taking through the site, search engine placement, how users find the site (referrers), common search terms used, along with other standard web analytics, and then integrated with a review of the kinds of questions encountered from the site by Network Kansas advisors.  Similar types of analysis of the current KBC could be undertaken and measured against the goals for the site (once established) with an eye toward optimizing the present methods of service delivery as well as understanding more about its current – and even prospective - audience.</p>

<p>Absent usability testing, the assessment of the flow and content/application delivery in the site must be subjective.  However, some observations follow:</p>

<h4>Landing Page usability.</h4>

<p>The presentation of the landing page at http://www.kansas.gov/businesscenter/ is branded Kansas Business Center, but the primary navigation and approximately 25% of the screen appears to be connected to the larger Kansas.gov portal. The “Find It” search does not search the Kansas Business Center site, but all of Kansas.gov.  And, the results page for that search provides no navigational elements that allow a return to the Kansas Business Center. In general, valuable screen space seems to be devoted to narrative that on other competing business one-stop sites has been streamlined (Note Commonwealth of Kentucky Business One-stop site on the following page below).</p>

<h4>Login to Kansas Business Center.  Clicking on the link to login to the Kansas Business Center causes another webpage to open, shown below:</h4>

<p>***Image</p>

<p>The site states that it will accept either an email or a Kansas.gov username. However, no context is provided about what a Kansas.gov username is or its relevance until one links to the “I’m a New User” page. Also, it is not clear why the Business Name Search is available from this page, especially as its necessity is heavily caveated.  When a user does follow the I’m a New User navigation, sh/e is presented with two options to log in:</p>

<p>The use of the term “Non-Kansas.gov Subscribers” to refer to entrepreneurs seeking to start a business presents a constraining/exclusionary perspective that is incongruent with the overall theme of support and ease of access for new business formation.</p>

<p>This situation appears to be further complicated by what is explained to be the need for current Kansas.gov subscribers to register with the Kansas Business Center even if they already have a valid Kansas.gov subscription.  See the Technology section below for further discussion.</p>

<p>Witness the State of Maryland’s One-Stop approach to login shown on the following page:</p>

<h4>Branding. Navigating through the site, the user is presented with a variety of URL’s that could cause confusion, as well as cases where links open another window – or do not – seeming to lack a consistent approach. In some cases, the domain name AccessKansas.org is used, in others Kansas.gov, and the SSL certificate used also displays “Information Network of Kansas” in the address bar. Examples follow:</h4>

<p>Selecting Login to the Kansas Business Center from the landing page returns a new window with the URL visible as http://www.kansas.gov/businesscenter/. This page that is returned displays links in the upper navigation to both Home and Login that link to the page one is already on.</p>

<p>Selecting Name Availability from the Thinking about Starting a Business page under Quick Resources takes a user to the same login page, only now the domain showing is https://www.accesskansas.org/businesscenter/index.html</p>

<p>However, clicking on the underlined words “available for use” under Register Your Business on the Thinking about Starting a Business Page does not open a new window and, again, takes the user to https://www.accesskansas.org/businesscenter/index.html</p>

<p>While, on their face, these few examples might seem minor, they suggest that a close review of the navigation and usability testing of the current Kansas Business Center site are in order until progress is made on a reinvention project.</p>
