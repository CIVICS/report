<h3>Single Sign-on</h3>

<h5>Single Sign-on mechanism, supported by a “many-to-many” capability for delegation of transaction authorization.</h5>

<p>One common issue facing business one-stop initiatives like the Kansas Business Center is the need to overcome silos in the organization of government services.  Chief among them is that of the separate username and password required by each government organization, and usually for each application made use of by a business filer.  In the case of the Kansas Business Center, and in business filing in general, this is especially problematic because the interactions with government – while they may be undertaken by individual entrepreneurs and business owners – are just as likely to be executed by third party intermediaries like accountants, attorneys, or even in bulk by national service bureaus.  In turn, within each of these organizations, there may be several levels of delegation.</p>

<p>Because of this, while a single sign-on concept is helpful, this needs to be further expanded to ensure that authorization can be appropriately delegated (the need and wisdom of revocation capability should be evaluated) to agents. This “many-to-many” example - common to state and local governments - is illustrated in a diagram taken from a recent State of Indiana (June 2013) Request for Information (14-010) shown below.  In this case, SOS is analogous to the Kansas Secretary of State, DWD – Department of Workforce Development to the Kansas Department of Labor, and DOR – Department of Revenue to the Kansas Department of Revenue.  While there may be nuance to the arrangement of particular business services and their delivery across units of government in each state, the issue of single sign-on and delegation of authorization remains. Use of the State of Indiana diagram is intended to emphasize how universal this requirement is. The level of authentication required across agencies may vary, so the technology used must support “step up” authentication to accommodate the level of proof of identity required.</p>
