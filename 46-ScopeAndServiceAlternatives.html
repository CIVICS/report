<h3>Scope and Service Alternatives</h3>

<p>Four options naturally present themselves as a potential scope for the Kansas Business Center project.  The following section provides context for their consideration as it relates to the possible scope of the project (Business Formation vs. Business Type), then presents and evaluates the four options, with a recommendation for next steps.</p>

<h5>“Business Formation” vs. “Business Type”</h5>

<p>To register and obtain a permit or license for a particular occupation or “type”, a business must first form a business “entity”.  There may also be a significant gap between the time a business is formed and registration and licensing related to a business type applied for and granted. And, while the State of Kansas requires registration and licensing for many categories of businesses – from egg dealers, to pesticide applicators, to auctioneers – registration and licensing may often be required by a city or county as well.</p>

<p>It is beyond the scope of this engagement to provide significant analysis of the registration and licensing processes that occur across all categories and occupations at both the state and local level in Kansas.  The 172-page Network Kansas publication titled “Steps to Success: A Step-by-Step Guide to Starting a Business” (http://www.networkkansas.com/docs/default-source/ntks-website/steps-to-success.pdf?sfvrsn=0) is illustrative.  It provides what is described as a “partial list of common businesses or areas that require registration/licensing/permits with specific agencies/commissions. New businesses should also check with their local city and county clerk to determine if either municipality requires any licenses/permits/zoning requirements.” While this “partial list” also includes professional occupations, it catalogs over 360 licenses or permits and repeats the warning that other licensing or permitting may be required at the local level.</p>

<p>Given the large number of organizations involved in occupational permitting and licensing, the potential diversity of their requirements and supporting manual and automated processes, and the varying technical sophistication of those individuals who may choose to start a business that falls into the regulated category, identifying a solution that can address this many licenses will be a significant challenge.</p>

<p>From a high-level review of other states, many have focused on the business formation process, which in Kansas would involve the Secretary of State’s office, Department of Revenue, and Department of Labor – the three agencies necessary to form a business that would have employees.  If the business has no employees, formation would not necessarily involve the Department of Labor. By definition, all businesses must pass this “gate” to form a business in Kansas, so focusing on this portion of the process – by necessity – impacts the greatest number of businesses.</p>

<p>In some cases in other states, the “business one-stop” has expanded to include enabling registration and filing for business type.  While the project budgets generally are in the millions of dollars, the investment required to extend functionality to include registration and licensing for business type with agencies outside the formation process is significantly higher, perhaps multiples of the cost of the former approach.</p>

<p>Thus, the potential approaches to further development of the Kansas Business Center concept lie along a continuum from small investments in the existing KBC to a full, integrated application-drive website that incorporates all business registration and licensing transactions in the state.  The level of investment in planning and preparation, staffing, funding, and time required vary proportionately, depending on the level of integration desired and the technological approach chosen to support the process.</p>

<p>In light of this discussion, we present four options for consideration with regard to the scope of a Kansas Business Center project:</p>

<h5>Option 1 – Partial State Business Formation</h5>

<p>This option entails rewriting existing business registration and filing functions delivered by the Secretary of State as well as potentially those delivered by the Kansas Department of Revenue (the latter were not reviewed as part of this report).  This could also take the form of enhancing those services by automating those that are not yet fully online.  This functionality could be thought of as building out the existing Kansas Business Center – although the technology and approach could be reinvented – which would allow the completion of all transactions necessary to form a business in Kansas.</p>

<p>Note: This scope might also include work with the federal government to integrate the ability for businesses to obtain a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN) via web services or some other technology without leaving the Kansas Business Center.</p>

<h5>Option 2 – Complete State Business Formation</h5>

<p>This option is essentially Option 1, but adds the capability to complete those transactions required by the Kansas Department of Labor to form a business that would have employees.  From materials available online about previous iterations of the Kansas Business Center, it appears possible that this functionality has been available through the KBC in the past, and it appears to be available on the KDOL website right now as a freestanding service.</p>

<h5>Option 3 – Complete State Business Formation + Business Type Registration</h5>

<p>Include some or all of the parties outlined in Partial State Business Formation or Complete State Business Formation scope along with one or more agencies involved in registration, licensing, or permitting for business type. This could also incorporate one or more processes where the local level of government requires additional registration, licensing, or permitting.</p>

<p>Evaluation of these alternatives is difficult to perform without a better understanding of several important criteria that pertain both to the priorities of the state and for addressing the “Triple Constraint” outlined above:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Option 3 Evaluation. While the state would obviously be interested in Option 3 - for some or all of the state’s business registration processes to be available via a One-Stop - from talking with other states, this option has proven to be very costly – both initially and for ongoing maintenance. It also involves some risk of failure given the complexity and management of resources required while agency operations continue “in flight”, and usually takes significant time to implement. No business case has been developed that shows the payback to the state or business for this investment. Given the diversity of agency systems and boundaries to be overcome and the challenges encountered to-date in improving the existing Kansas Business Center, Option 3 is not the best choice for scope at the present time given the state’s level of preparation and commitment.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluation of Option 1 and 2: The same issues are encountered in trying to evaluate these options – What level of executive support is there for this scope?  What kind of cost would be encountered and how willing are the parties to commit? Would the existing Kansas Business Center be built out or a new investment made in developing another website. While recommendations on these choices is addressed below and in the Recommendations and Next Steps section of the report, a more limited scope such as that outlined in Option 1 or 2 is the most appropriate place for the State to start in their reinvention effort.</p></li>
</ul>
