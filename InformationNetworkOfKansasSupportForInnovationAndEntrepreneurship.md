As noted in the introduction to this section, in its first two decades, the Information Network of Kansas model was a groundbreaking innovation in service funding and delivery.  Now, the current INK Board has an opportunity to again “move the needle” on innovation by turning its focus to a number of nascent efforts to open up government data at the local and national level.

By statute, the Information Network of Kansas is charged to (K.S.A 74-9302): 

“…explore ways and means of expanding the amount and kind of public information provided, increasing the utility of the public information provided and the form in which provided, expanding the base of users who access such public information and, where appropriate, implementing such changes;” 

and to

“…explore technological ways and means of improving citizen and business access to public information and, where appropriate, implement such technological improvements;”

The INK Board is uniquely charged with the responsibility to explore the kinds of innovation in information delivery that are outlined in the “Environmental Scan: Focus on Innovation” section of this report.  The following recommendations call for a renewed vision for INK that places an emphasis on two pieces of INK’s statutory foundation:

Expanding Access to Public Information

and

Increasing the Utility of Information Provided

The Time is Now

This focus on public information aligns very closely with the economic development program of the state.  The following excerpt from the Governor’s Strategic Economic Development plan (2011) provides the principle:

> Focus state resources on important activities that the state can do best: supply the “public goods” parts of the >economic development process.
>Kansas Governor’s Strategic Economic Development Plan
>http://governor.ks.gov/economic-development-strategic-plan

Information Network of Kansas can deliver the “goods”.  The spirit of INK is not about technology.  INK is about innovation, creativity, and flexibility – a public-private partnership exempt from state procurement regulations, with broad representation on its leadership board with the intent of fostering partnerships, experimentation, and innovation beyond the horizons of state bureaucracy.

To move to a national leadership position in innovation, the INK Board should capitalize on the work going on in the field of Open Data and electronic government innovation in service delivery occurring at the local level. These new ideas and energy that can be imported and leveraged to the state level to deliver on the second part of INK’s mission, to increase the utility of the information provided to citizens, businesses, and other interested parties in ways that can serve as a platform for third-party innovation.  The following recommendations offer new ways to take advantage of current national trends that can also feed economic development efforts and attract entrepreneurship around the Kansas Business Center and related initiatives.
