<h3>Appendix B – Exploration of Opportunities for Innovation with Nationally-Recognized Experts in Technology, Government, and Innovation</h3>

<h5>Exploring the Future of the Information Network of Kansas</h5>

<p>Although a comprehensive discussion of the meetings and activities related to this work with Dazza and MIT is beyond the scope of this document, a brief explanation is provided as context for its relationship to the work in the Statement of Work contained in the contract discussed below, as well as to emphasize the level of effort and value provided by Dazza and other representatives of MIT’s Human Dynamics area of the Media Lab.</p>

<h5>MIT Kerberos and Internet Trust Consortium</h5>

<p>In his role at MIT, Dazza facilitated discussion on the Kansas Business Center and future strategic direction of INK, along with various approaches to how a relationship with MIT might be structured.  These options included working with (or joining) the MIT Kerberos and Internet Trust Consortium. MIT’s Kerberos Consortium includes representatives like Oracle, Microsoft, NASA and the Department of Defense (DOD) in supporting the source code for Kerberos, “the most widely deployed system for authentication and authorization in modern computer networks.” (http://www.kerberos.org/index.html). The MIT Kerberos and Internet Trust (KIT) Consortium (http://kit.mit.edu/) is a relatively new offshoot with a mission to develop the basic building blocks for the Internet&rsquo;s emerging personal data ecosystem in which people, organizations, and computers can manage access to their data more efficiently and equitably.  This organization is of special interest because it recently acquired source code developed by Mitre Corporation, a DOD contractor, that can be used in secure authentication and sharing of data.  The KIT also includes community and advisory board members such as Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Stanford University and Fidelity Investments, demonstrating industry interest and commitment by major companies in this space to their efforts. More detail on the Mitre software, and the KIT can be found at: http://kit.mit.edu/projects/mitreid-connect and http://kit.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/MIT_KIT_2013_Background_web.pdf?. Via Dazza’s coordination, our contact and work in this area was with Dr. Thomas Hardjono, Executive Director and Technical Lead for both organizations. We met and presented with him at the Human Dynamics area of the MIT Media Lab as well as participated in interactive video conferencing via Google Hangouts.</p>

<h5>Dr. Alex “Sandy” Pentland/MIT Media Lab Entrepreneurship and Digital Innovations Seminar</h5>

<p>As part of our initial discussions and in support of the charge of the INK subcommittee regarding the RFP, Dazza, in his role as MIT Adjunct Instructor worked with the head of the Human Dynamics Lab, Dr. Alex Pentland, to arrange a presentation soliciting ideas from the above-referenced class about possible next steps on both the Kansas Business Center and the Information Network of Kansas model.  Dr. Pentland is a world-renown computer scientist, and director of both the MIT Media Lab’s Human Dynamics Laboratory and the Media Lab Entrepreneurship program (http://www.media.mit.edu/people/sandy). This is the flagship class for the MIT Media Lab program that has produced a large number of startup companies (see: http://www.media.mit.edu/sponsorship/spin-offs for a list of Media Lab spinoffs) and where students were currently engaged in developing proposals for MIT’s $100K Entrepreneurship Competition http://www.mit100k.org/general/ that has produced over 160 companies.  We presented live via Google Hangout to the class to solicit their questions and ideas on innovative approaches to both the Information Network of Kansas model and the Next Generation Kansas Business Center. Dazza was instrumental in this effort, spending a large amount of time outside work arranging, developing, and facilitating the presentation. More information on the course can be found at: http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/15/sp13/15.376/.</p>

<h5>MIT Media Lab and Human Dynamics Lab Visit and KBC Prototype Discussions</h5>

<p>In Dazza’s role as an adjunct professor, he also arranged and hosted a visit for State of Kansas representatives at the MIT Media Lab where we presented questions and concepts around the KBC to Dr. Pentland. We worked with a student to conduct a preliminary evaluation of how his project’s use of federated credentials and a private personal data store to enable participants to protect data for a 4,000 person study at Denmark Technical University might be useful in addressing problems encountered by Kansas entrepreneurs in negotiating the cumbersome process of multiple sign-ons and continuous re-entry of the same basic data across licensing applications silo’d in individual agencies. Dazza dedicated significant time before, during, and after this visit to working on a prototype architecture and straw man demonstration of these concepts, an example of which can be viewed online at: http://youtu.be/DIyWeH-CGfM.</p>

<p>Both Dazza and Dr. Pentland are involved in a group created through a federal effort by the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC) (http://www.nist.gov/nstic/about-nstic.html) called the Identity Ecosystem Steering Group (http://www.idecosystem.org/), where Dazza is currently vice chair. Access to this set of expertise in considering ways to streamline the current repetitive and cumbersome authentication process for business entity formation and licensing were greatly aided by Dazza’s efforts and involvement.</p>

<h5>Dr. Beth Noveck, MIT Media Lab, and the NYU Governance Lab</h5>

<p>The Information Network of Kansas serves as a groundbreaking model nationally, and, in exploring the potential to reinvent both the INK Model for the RFP and the next generation Kansas Business Center, the SOS contacted Dr. Beth Noveck of New York University.  Dr. Noveck is an internationally known scholar and practitioner in Open Data and Institutional Innovation, and served as the first deputy chief technology officer for Open Government for the U.S. Government.  Currently, she is a co-founder and director of the Governance Lab at NYU, a project that brings technological innovations to bear in improving citizen participation in government.  As a result of this outreach, she invited the Secretary of State, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, Jim Minihan, and a representative of OITS to attend a conference where a special session was developed to focus on soliciting innovative approaches to the Kansas Business Center, featuring a prototype “Business Sensor” mobile application developed by Greg Elin, Knight Foundation award winner and Chief Data Officer for the Federal Communications Commission that was presented to representatives from the MacArthur and Knight Foundations, along with Sir Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the World Wide Web) and a number of open government innovators.</p>

<p>Alongside this work, Dazza developed a presentation on the MIT prototype architecture and attended the conference in support of the state of Kansas. As an outcome of this conference and presentation, SOS has developed numerous professional contacts with regard to the KBC and remains in contact with Dr. Noveck and the principals of the NYU Governance Lab with regard to potential future initiatives, including the KBC.
