<h1><strong>PART I:</strong>  <strong>History and Functions of the Kansas Business Center</strong></h1><h1></h1><h2>Mission</h2><p>Establishing the appropriate future state for Kansas Business Center must be based upon a review of its mission and purpose. The <em>Kansas Business Center</em> (KBC) was initially deployed online in December 2002. The KBC was redeployed with a new interface and capabilities on December 22, 2008. The website referred to in this report is currently located at: <a href="http://www.kansas.gov/businesscenter/">http://www.kansas.gov/businesscenter/</a>.  </p>
<p>The mission/purpose of the Kansas Business Center has been referred to in at least two ways over time.</p>
<ul><li>In a 2003 nomination for recognition by the National Association of State Chief Information Officers (NASCIO) Digital Government award in the Government-to-Business category, it is described as a “_one-stop business resource for state government._” This characterization is especially relevant as this nomination was submitted by the Information Network of Kansas and outlined future plans for the KBC.</li><li>In a June 2009 announcement in the Network Kansas monthly newsletter, the lead article refers to the KBC as <em>“the official online state resource for information, filings, and personal assistance to start or maintain a Kansas business.”</em> This mirrors the statement of purpose located on the home page of the KBC website <strong>and will be considered definitive as the</strong> <strong>_current_</strong> <strong>Mission Statement for this report</strong>.</li></ul>
<h1>Strategic Alignment</h1><p>To successfully align the opportunities for innovation in the service delivery model for the Kansas Business Center, it is necessary to trace the mission outlined above to its foundation in the strategic goals established by both the Information Network of Kansas Board of Directors and the State of Kansas, and to place them in the context of recent efforts at improvement. The following review should not be considered comprehensive, but provides excerpts from key documents related to the history and purpose of the KBC – as well as commitments - that provide the base from which the current efforts should build.</p>
<h2></h2><h2>State Government Goals: Kansas Business Center</h2><p>Because the Kansas Business Center has existed in some form for over ten years, it has likely been discussed in a number of settings and included in various planning documents that support technology and business initiatives at the State. The following excerpts provide the most recent thread of statements about its purpose and planned improvements in technology planning documents available online:</p>
<p><strong>Excerpt:</strong> 2007 Kansas Economic Development Strategic Plan</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 39 – Enhance the Kansas Business Center (KBC).</strong> </p>
<p>39-1 Expand cross-agency application development efforts and communication with the Information Network of Kansas to create a single online location for new and existing businesses to utilize for acquiring region-specific state and local resources and contacts; federal, state, and local regulatory compliance; and provide for an online environment designed to enhance the ability for Kansas businesses to thrive. </p>
<p><strong>Excerpt:</strong>  <em>Strategic Information Management Plan – Action Plan – November 2008</em></p>
<p><strong>2.3 Understand &amp; Improve Government-To-Business Business Processes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Outcomes:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Refine Government-To-Business interactions with the business customer’s perspective to provide more consistent approaches for interactions to increase customer satisfaction.</li><li>Increase the amount of integrated government services on the Internet for Kansas businesses.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Action Plan:</strong></p>
<p>2008	Invite the CITA to work with the Kansas Business Center (KBC) to do business process modeling.</p>
<p>2009	Use the KBC as a pilot project to develop the scope and detail for business process modeling.</p>
<p>2009	All new services delivered in the KBC will have a process model.</p>
<p>2010	All existing KBC business processes will be submitted to the Kansas Business Process Repository and will be updated as they change.</p>
<p>**Requirements/Design Efforts: 2009-2010</p>
<p>Efforts were made in the 2009-2010 timeframe to realize goals in the state’s 2008 Strategic Information Management (SIM) plan that pertain to the KBC, resulting in a set of high-level architectural diagrams for a proposed expansion of the KBC and a grant proposal to the Board, dated November 30, 2010, for this work . It is not clear whether or not that proposal was submitted to the INK Board.</p>
<p>The next revisiting of the Kansas Business Center in State IT goals and planning documents appears to be as an outcome of an IT consolidation feasibility study completed in October 2010. The following excerpts related to the KBC are taken from that report.</p>
<p><strong>Excerpts:</strong> <em>Information Technology Consolidation Study – October 2010</em> </p>
<p><strong>One Statewide Identity Management Solution for Businesses</strong></p>
<p>Leverage the knowledge that exists with the Kansas Business Center and develop a roadmap to accomplish their vision of a collaborative business portal. This option will support an enterprise view of documentation and reduce the complexity and silos that exist in the current support of Kansas businesses. The ITIMG should continue to develop their risk matrix and determine a limited set of identity solutions that all agencies should use for government to business interactions.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The State should charge the Kansas Business Center and the IT Identity Management Workgroup to create a roadmap outlining a common approach to government-to-business exchanges including how to share a common identity between systems. This roadmap should guide all system investments, upgrades, and enhancements. This will make Kansas more attractive to businesses because there will be less cost and effort involved to start up and conduct business in Kansas.</p>
<p>The most recent state IT planning document - <em>25 Information Technology Initiatives to Lower IT Costs or Improve State IT Efficiency</em> - does not devote a specific initiative to the Kansas Business Center. However, it outlines an effort to create a common platform for automation of licensing and registration processes that would support the KBC.</p>
<p><strong>Excerpt:</strong> 25 Information Technology Initiatives to Lower IT Costs or Improve State IT Efficiency (May 2012)</p>
<p><strong>Initiative 15: Shift to a Centralized Licensing and Registration System</strong></p>
<p>The Office of Information Technology Services (OITS) Small Agency Support Unit spends a fair amount of its time helping state boards and commissions maintain various custom databases and systems that are used to track their membership information and handle their licensing and registration. These one-off processes are highly in-efficient and the results, while sufficient, never rise to the level of what can be delivered from a COTS package designed specifically to handle this work. </p>
<p>In addition, with licensing and registration processes handled in disparate systems around the state, being able to identify a unique individual or business entity across different systems becomes extremely difficult. With the Kansas Business Center tasked with simplifying the process of starting a business in Kansas, moving the majority of licensing and registration processes into a single software solution will begin to allow us to track a "package" or set of registrations that might be required for a business even though those processes cross agencies. </p>
<h2>Information Network of Kansas Goals: Kansas Business Center</h2><p>The original Kansas Business Center went live at the end of 2002, and the following excerpt reflects statements made in that year’s annual report about expectations going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Excerpt:</strong> Information Network of Kansas 2002 Annual Report - Planned Initiatives: Year 2003</p>
<p><strong>Kansas Business Center - Phase II</strong> </p>
<p>The expansion of the KBC includes ideas such as online annual report filings, portal enhancements allowing more flexibility to the user, alcohol &amp; tobacco tax filings, business name and address changes, business tax filing renewals, and fine payments. </p>
<p><strong>Excerpt:</strong> Information Network of Kansas 2003 Strategic E-Government Plan</p>
<p><strong>1</strong>. <strong>Kansas Business Center.</strong> INK will work with State agencies and local units of government to develop integrated applications that support opening and sustaining a business in Kansas. INK will work to integrate with federal and state entities to provide access to grant and financial assistance information. INK will also continue to expand the access and integration to agency’s systems. Service examples include; Kansas Business Center Wizard, Annual Reports filings, Background Security Checks, Business Entity Certificates of Good Standing, and Homeland Security Notification System.</p>
<p>Expectations for the future development of the Kansas Business Center are revisited in the INK Strategic e-Government Plan for 2007-2009, and then – more briefly - in the 2011-2014 Strategic Plan. </p>
<p><strong>Excerpt:</strong> Information Network of Kansas 2007-2009 Strategic E-Government Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Kansas Business Center</strong></p>
<p>Continue to work with Secretary of State Officials, the Kansas Department of Labor, the Kansas Department of Commerce, and others to expand service offerings and focus on developing enhanced services to assist with required business filings with the State. In addition, coordinate with the Kansas Small Business Development Center and Center for Entrepreneurship to assist in developing a comprehensive tool set for new and existing businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Excerpt:</strong> Information Network of Kansas Strategic 2011-2014 Plan</p>
<p>Complete the Kansas Business Center data integration initiative with appropriate entities.</p>
<p>In turn, the 2012 and 2013 (_draft as of this writing_) Business Plans also address the KBC:</p>
<p><strong>Excerpt:</strong> 2012 Information Network of Kansas Business Plan</p>
<p><em>While the 2011 INK Business plan does not mention specific actions to improve the KBC, the 2012 INK Business Plan indicates intent to leverage a strategic alliance with Iron Data for the KBC, and states:</em></p>
<p><strong>Kansas Business Center:</strong> The INK Board of Directors has allocated $160,000 toward the development of a system to consolidate the registration and maintenance of reporting requirements for businesses in Kansas. The strategic vision is to provide businesses one online location to register and license their business with several agencies. This initiative would eliminate business duplication of effort, provide a more rapid response, and create a more efficient method of data collection for agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Excerpt:</strong> May 2013 draft of 2013 Business Plan</p>
<p>Kansas Business Center: The INK Board of Directors has allocated $500,000 toward the support of the development of a cross agency application to assist Kansas businesses with the online ability to register and maintain business filing requirements with the state. Ten percent or $50,000 of this amount has been designated for industry expert seminars and education for the benefit of INK and the state enterprise.</p>
<h2>Recent Activities Addressing Kansas Business Center Improvement</h2><p>The plans above show a recurrent, although somewhat uneven, focus on a goal of further improvement of the Kansas Business Center. To better understand how the current effort to identify opportunities for innovation fits with recent efforts, we conducted a cursory review of the minutes of Information Network of Kansas Board meetings and Executive Director and General Manager reports. While this method of research has some shortcomings that may result in less than a full catalog of activities and participants, the resulting timeline reveals some significant lapses in continuity that raises questions about the level of commitment to the goals outlined in the planning documents cited above. The timeline below begins about one year after the 2009-2010 improvement efforts.</p>

<ul><li>The SOS Annual Report filing project began in late summer and demonstrates an incremental approach to business services recommended in this report. Further information about this project is included in the Kansas Business Center 3.0 section.</li></ul>
<h2>Observations</h2><p>When recent activities in support of the improvement of the Kansas Business Center are set in the context of the history of planning and goal-setting efforts by both the State and the Information Network of Kansas, several aspects stand out:</p>
<ul><li>There has been a long-standing publicly stated purpose to provide a one-stop location online for new and existing businesses to conduct all their interactions with the State. This was most recently re-emphasized in two meetings with the Governor and with his cabinet in fall 2011.  </li><li>Despite recurring statements of this intent and some efforts at exploring possibilities in the period 2009-2010 and recently in the form of this report, the Kansas Business Center has not significantly expanded scope or technology in the last five years. Starts and stops of this nature are not unusual in business one-stop efforts as one can see from the state interviews included later in this report.</li><li>There appear to be questions throughout this two-year period on the approach to be used, with directions seemingly set toward one vendor (Iron Data), then later another (System Automation), and, most recently, interest in a potential MIT solution has been discussed, along with potential solutions from EMC and Perceptive Software.</li><li>The importance of a statewide identity management solution in support of a “collaborative business portal” was recommended as part of an IT consolidation study completed in October 2010. However, the_Information Technology Identity Management Group_ (_ITIMG_) does not appear to have been formally charged with this initiative, nor does any action in direct support of this goal appear to have occurred since that time</li><li>Expansion/improvement of the KBC is not shown as a goal in current state planning documents. At present, no stakeholder groups have beenformally convened, nor has any formally developed business case or itemized budget for any further development been constructed. Records show that there was $160,000 budgeted for the KBC in the 2012 INK Business Plan and $500,000 in the 2013 INK Business Plan.</li></ul>
<p>Specific actions related to the challenges the state is facing in planning and execution in this area are included in the Next Steps and Recommendations section of this report.</p>
<h1>Current State: Kansas Business Center Website, Services, and Transactions</h1><p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>This section provides a high-level overview of the functions of the current Kansas Business Center, located online at: <a href="http://www.kansas.gov/businesscenter/">http://www.kansas.gov/businesscenter/</a>. The functionality related to the Kansas Secretary of State’s office has been confirmed by them. The discussion of the Kansas Department of Revenue functionality is taken directly from a review of the site and has not been verified with their management.</p>
<p>**Usage of the Kansas Business Center**Information about the current and historical us</p>
<p>e of the Kansas Business Center website is provided below. </p>
<p><strong>Kansas Business Center Page Views</strong> </p>
<p>(_excerpted from Kansas.gov August 2013 report_)**</p>
<p>Without further investigation of the scope and basis of the report – several additional statistical reports are provided with it – it is difficult to make definitive statements about the usage of the site. For example, on its face, it is not clear what has resulted in the lower numbers for 2013 – this could be a technical issue, for example. Overall, the traffic appears to be in the range of 20,000-50,000 page views per month since 2009, remaining relatively steady except for the more recent downturn.</p>
<p>Recommendations about analysis of Kansas Business Center website traffic and the potential value of enhanced analytics related to activity occurring on and in the environment of the site are provided in the Next Steps and Recommendations of this report.</p>
<h2>Services</h2><p><strong>Assistance in Starting or Maintaining a Business</strong></p>
<p>The specific transactions that can be conducted by users of the site with the Kansas Secretary of State’s office and the Kansas Department of Revenue sit within a framework of supporting information and services provided by Network Kansas (see <a href="http://www.networkkansas.com/about">http://www.networkkansas.com/about</a>). A Google Search of this domain reveals the KBC site is composed of about twenty (20) html pages that are accessible outside the login page.</p>
<p>The primary navigation of the website is divided into four sections intended to address questions related to phases in the life of a business: <em>Thinking</em>; <em>Starting</em>; <em>Maintaining</em>; <em>Closing</em>. The web site also provides free access to referral coordinators at Network Kansas via a toll-free number and a link to a “Live Support Chat” function to help users answer questions in these areas. The site also has links to a_Resource Navigator_ that directs users to “more than 400 resources that are ready to help.” Finally, it provides links into the materials hosted on the Network Kansas website (see above) to help answer questions and provide overall guidance to businesses on a variety of issues.</p>
<p>Network Kansas officials report that the Kansas Business Center website is a significant driver of referrals to the assistance they provide, which now total close to 200 per month (from all sources).</p>
<h2>Transactions</h2><p>The transactions and functionality available for users to conduct through the Kansas Business Center website can be divided into those associated with the Kansas Secretary of State and those associated with the Kansas Department of Revenue.</p>

<h2></h2><h2>Technology Platform</h2><p>Along with the review of the user-facing functionality of the Kansas Business Center, we anticipated conducting a high-level review of the technology platforms that support it.  </p>
<p>However, we were not able to examine the code or infrastructure supporting it directly to evaluate the capabilities of the technical architecture for extensibility.</p>
<p>The primary technology footprint supporting the Kansas Business Center is provided by the Information Network of Kansas. From conversations with technicians familiar with the application, it appears that the components of the current site involve the use of HTML, Java, Java Server Pages (JSP), XML, CSS, Perl, SQL, and the Struts framework. It also appears that permissions from some of the SQL select permissions are created in a way that can emulate “federation” of (cross-agency) access to the data. The Secretary of State’s office reports that in most cases the online application duplicates databases that then replicate data and transaction records to core systems at the agency. The architecture was not confirmed for the Kansas Department of Revenue applications.</p>
<p>Because an important question about the future direction of the Kansas Business Center revolves around the extensibility of the current architecture, <strong>the lack of a more detailed evaluation of this issue is an important omission from this report</strong>. However, this issue will need to be revisited as part of any formal project to reinvent and extend the KBC. A cursory evaluation of technical approach in use isprovided in the corresponding portion of following evaluation and general recommendations are contained in the Next Steps and Recommendations section of this report.</p>
<h1><strong>PART II: Evaluating the Current Kansas Business Center</strong></h1><p>The Kansas Business Center has been deployed as an online destination for Kansas businesses for a little over ten years. Extrapolating from recent information provided about its use, the site has likely received millions of page views during its life to-date and is considered an integral part of service delivery to new and existing businesses by a key partner in supporting business activity in the state,_Network Kansas_.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the Kansas Business Center can be considered a success. The fact that content from Network Kansas is delivered in association with the website, and that a “live chat” feature is available to support users attempting to navigate the process of starting or maintaining a business is a real plus. Finally, in a review of both state and Information Network of Kansas planning documents, and a strategic plan for economic development in the state, enhancement of the Kansas Business Center continues to be featured as a goal. While it is as an outgrowth of this interest that this report was commissioned, the standard against with to measure the success of the Kansas Business Center has not been clearly stated to-date. Absent this, multiple perspectives can be used:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Usability/User Interface.</strong> In the previous section, a high-level catalog of the primary functions available through the site is provided and this could be used to perform usability tests with potential audiences for the site to determine areas where navigation could be improved (see <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/usability-testing.html">http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/usability-testing.html</a>). This effort could be coupled with analysis of the routes individual users are taking through the site, search engine placement, how users find the site (referrers), common search terms used, along with other standard web analytics, and then integrated with a review of the kinds of questions encountered from the site by Network Kansas advisors. Similar types of  analysis of the current KBC could be undertaken and measured against the goals for the site (once established) with an eye toward optimizing the present methods of service delivery as well as understanding more about its current – and even prospective - audience.</li><li>**Scope, Services, and Level of Integration.**Taking another tack, the focus of attention could be placed on the functionality as it relates to the statement on the website calling itself “the official online state resource for information, filings, and personal assistance to start or maintain a Kansas business.” In that case, while it appears that it addresses less than 1% of the business filings that could be required for the 360+ business types regulated in some form by the state as reported in the Network Kansas publication “Steps to Success: A Step-by-step Guide to Starting a Business, it does provide some portion of the functionality required to form a business in Kansas. From an integration perspective, only the Kansas Secretary of State’s applications were reviewed as part of this report. However, one approach available here would be to inventory the systems that support business registration and licensing in the state, prioritize them based on the scope of functionality targeted for the site, and then judge progress to-date against that measure. While this is beyond the scope of effort for this report, further work in this area is addressed in the Next Steps and Recommendations section.</li><li>**Vision and Governance.**The focus could be on governance, the goals for the site and its performance against documented expectations. While not “visible” on the site, the website and its functionality should be an outgrowth of this foundation and it is important that the operation of the KBC be tightly coupled to its sponsorship and both strategic and operational vision. This would include measures used to inform decisions.</li><li>**Technology.**The underlying technical architecture and technologies used on the site might be evaluated in terms of cost and ability to support them, extensibility to other agencies (which could also include a brief assessment of the technologies, architecture and other capabilities of systems that might be required to be rewritten or “plug-in” to the architecture), and similar aspects. We were not able togain access to the technical infrastructure for this report, although some limited work (see previous section) was done to provide context. The Next Steps and Recommendations section includes guidance on possible next steps.</li></ul>
<p><strong>In examining these perspectives to approaching the Kansas Business Center, it becomes obvious that any evaluation will be severely impaired by the lack of an established framework for evaluation.</strong>  <strong>What is the Kansas Business Center supposed to do?</strong>  **What is the desired scope and roadmap for its achievement? What are its annual goals for use, for expansion, for customer satisfaction?**While the current site represents itself as “The official online state resource for information, filings, and personal assistance to start or maintain a Kansas business”, there does not appear to be a set of ongoing goals and metrics against which its success is measured. This situation is not improved by the general nature of the goals outlined in either the state or INK strategic plans for the KBC that were surveyed earlier in this report.</p>
<p>Lacking specific metrics against which to assess the performance of the existing KBC, the following high-level analysis takes a mixed approach, drawing from those frames outlined above where the work can be accomplished with a limited investment of resources and possible opportunities for improvement identified. In turn, the Next Steps and Recommendations section of this report provides a base set of suggestions on direction for the formal mission and success metrics for the next-generation Kansas Business Center.</p>
<h3>Usability/User Interface</h3><p>Absent usability testing, the assessment of the flow and content/application delivery in the site must be subjective. However, some observations follow:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Landing Page usability.</strong> The presentation of the landing page at <a href="http://www.kansas.gov/businesscenter/">http://www.kansas.gov/businesscenter/</a> is branded <em>Kansas Business Center</em>, but the primary navigation and approximately 25% of the screen appears to be connected to the larger Kansas.gov portal. The “Find It” search does not search the Kansas Business Center site, but all of Kansas.gov. And, the results page for that search provides no navigational elements that allow a return to the Kansas Business Center. In general, valuable screen space seems to be devoted to narrative that on other competing business one-stop sites has been streamlined (Note Commonwealth of Kentucky Business One-stop site on the following page below).</li></ul>
<p><strong>Kansas Business Center Landing Page</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commonwealth of Kentucky One-Stop Landing Page</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Login to Kansas Business Center.</strong>  Clicking on the link to login to the Kansas Business Center causes another webpage to open, shown below:</li></ul>
<p>The site states that it will accept either an email or a Kansas.gov username. However, no context is provided about what a Kansas.gov username is or its relevance until one links to the “I’m a New User” page. Also, it is not clear why the Business Name Search is available from this page, especially as its necessity is heavily caveated. When a user does follow the_I’m a New User_ navigation, sh/e is presented with two options to log in:</p>
<p>The use of the term “Non-Kansas.gov Subscribers” to refer to entrepreneurs seeking to start a business presents a constraining/exclusionary perspective that is incongruent with the overall theme of support and ease of access for new business formation.</p>
<p>This situation appears to be further complicated by what is explained to be the need for current Kansas.gov subscribers to register with the Kansas Business Center even if they already have a valid Kansas.gov subscription. See the_Technology_ section below for further discussion.</p>
<p>Witness the State of Maryland’s One-Stop approach to login shown on the following page:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Branding.</strong> Navigating through the site, the user is presented with a variety of URL’s that could cause confusion, as well as cases where links open another window – or do not – seeming to lack a consistent approach. In some cases, the domain name AccessKansas.org is used, in others Kansas.gov, and the SSL certificate used also displays “Information Network of Kansas” in the address bar. Examples follow:</li></ul>
<ol><li>Selecting <em>Login</em> <em>to the Kansas Business Center</em> from the landing page returns a new window with the URL visible as <a href="http://www.kansas.gov/businesscenter/">http://www.kansas.gov/businesscenter/</a>. This page that is returned displays links in the upper navigation to both <em>Home</em> and <em>Login</em> that link to the page one is already on.</li><li>Selecting <em>Name Availability</em> from the <em>Thinking about Starting a Business</em> page under <em>Quick Resources</em> takes a user to the same login page, only now the domain showing is <a href="https://www.accesskansas.org/businesscenter/index.html">https://www.accesskansas.org/businesscenter/index.html</a></li><li>However, clicking on the underlined words “available for use” under <em>Register Your Business</em> on the <em>Thinking about Starting a Business Page</em> does not open a new window and, again, takes the user to <a href="https://www.accesskansas.org/businesscenter/index.html">https://www.accesskansas.org/businesscenter/index.html</a></li></ol>
<p>While, on their face, these few examples might seem minor, they suggest that a close review of the navigation and usability testing of the current Kansas Business Center site are in order until progress is made on a reinvention project.</p>
<h3>Scope, Services, and Level of Integration</h3><p>While during the course of this review, there has been considerable discussion about the possibility, need, and desire for broadening the horizontal reach of the Kansas Business Center to include additional state agencies, the scope of the agencies included appears to have remained close to the same for the last ten years. In fact, the May 23, 2003 submission for a National Association of State Chief Information Officers award made by_accessKansas_ (previous branding of the state portal) indicated that <strong>Unemployment Insurance Liability Determinations</strong> were available through the KBC at that time – this appears to no longer be the case.</p>
<p>The specific services currently available through the Kansas Business Center are listed in the section labeled _Transactions_above. Several aspects are notable:</p>
<ul><li><strong>At least one service related to forming a business with employees is missing</strong>. While it appears that the core services required to form a business are linked to in some fashion on the website, for a business that will have employees, there is no connection shown to the Department of Labor’s Unemployment Insurance determination application.</li><li>**There are a number of services shown that cannot be performed entirely online.**Whether this is due to statutory or policy barriers, or technical/resource limitations related to the site, it leaves the impression that there are additional efficiencies to be achieved. It is also not clear what services are not listed that might also be added to the KBC as it relates to business registration and filing required to form an entity.</li><li><strong>The ability to obtain a federal tax identification number is not integrated</strong>. The federal tax ID would require work with the federal government, but integration with the Kansas Department of Revenue to maintain application “flow” when establishing a business seems an important goal.</li><li>**Payment Functionality/Shopping Cart.**The Kansas Business Center makes use of “KanPay”, a proprietary payment engine offered through the Kansas Information Consortium. This payment approach lacks full “shopping cart” functionality integrated into the site. However, absent testing or an examination of the underlying technology, it appears to serve the purpose it was designed for.</li><li><strong>There does not appear to be any integration with registration/licensing of business “type”.</strong>  While this could be considered a notable omission, <strong>a number of business one-stop websites in other states do not extend functionality beyond business formation.</strong> Including this functionality to allow end-to-end registration and licensing of users for particular business types is possible, but it appears to be a very significant effort, both from the cost and effort required to create, and to maintain such functional integration on an ongoing basis. To be successful, this integration should also recognize that significant portions of the registration and licensing for business type require vertical integration to the county or city level. A mature approach to this functionality will also require a commonly agreed upon approach to authentication and data sharing if it is to streamline the process for the user. Given some of the challenges outlined in the <em>Vision and Governance</em> section that follows, expanding the scope of the KBC in this manner will require a strong vision, dedicated resources, and full executive sponsorship.</li></ul>
<h3></h3><h2>Vision and Governance</h2><p>The Kansas Business Center is mentioned periodically in both Information Network of Kansas and both state IT and business planning documents. There is also evidence that a group of stakeholders were convened in the 2009-2010 period to investigate possible improvements in the KBC. However, as it stands today,**it appears that there is no formal guiding framework established under which the KBC is operating, no stakeholder-based governance committee, nor are there specific goals or metrics associated with its performance, and, in turn, no dedicated resources and or level of priority established across agencies that would result in their achievement.**</p>
<p>The lack of formal governance made up of key stakeholders, along with ongoing goal setting and monitoring progress against success metrics is a significant challenge to further improvement of the KBC. For example, the Commonwealth of Kentucky’s effort to improve their business one-stop involved the creation – by statute - of a Portal Advisory Committee with representatives from a number of cabinet agencies key to economic development in the state, chaired by representative from the Secretary of State and Governor’s office. In the State of Washington, the Governor signed legislation that required the creation of a business one-stop collaboratively by six agencies which included a requirement for to establish performance benchmarks and to create a plan that would how they would “collaborate with the business community in order to receive business feedback and use business recommendations in the development of the one-stop business portal” and provide regular reporting on ways in which that has occurred (State of Washington, Chapter 31, 2013 Laws 2nd Special Session). There are many examples in other state one-stop projects of ongoing oversight and planning for such efforts that appears to be lacking in Kansas at this time. </p>
<p>Based on the material made available, this also manifests itself in reporting deficiencies. While the web traffic reports provide some high-level measures of activity, there does not appear to be any ongoing, consolidated, and readily available set of reports tracking the number of registered users, or the overall level of business filing. And, of course, without formal goals developed in relation to (and making use of input from) target audiences, nor a business case documenting measurable return on investment to either the state or business community, it would be difficult to evaluate the meaning of these types of metrics and whether or not they represented adequate progress.</p>
<p>Another challenge presented by lack of consolidated stakeholder-based governance is **the lack of a process or venue for coordination of online service delivery efforts.**From available documentation, it appears that the Department of Labor has an online portal that allows for UI determination and a number of other filing functions apart from the KBC, and that the Department of Revenue is in the planning stages of a “Virtual Tax Center” that might also be free-standing separately from the KBC. The potential for integration of these efforts, or the efficiencies to be achieved from a user perspective, is unknown, but a mechanism for planning and coordination of such efforts with the larger Kansas Business Center strategy appears to be missing.</p>
<p>See <em>Next Steps and Recommendations</em> section for further suggestions in this area.</p>
<h2></h2><h2>Technology</h2><p>A comprehensive review of the technical architecture of the services provided through the Kansas Business Center is beyond the scope of this report. Also, absent access to the underlying code, it is difficult to conjecture about the general supportability and extensibility of the services currently offered. The Technology portion of the preceding section provides limited information about the technologies used on the site. However, based on this information and a review of the site, the following observations appear relevant:</p>
<ul><li>**Robust Reporting/Analytics lacking.**From the high-level traffic reports reviewed, it does not appear that a software layer (logging, reporting, data export) has been created to view analytics about the activity, as well as analyze/correlate and report on activity conducted within the functionality of the Kansas Business Center, especially across the two agencies currently participating – or with Network Kansas or other partners. That is, while some limited web traffic reports are generated, the activity within the applications, for example, shopping cart abandonment does not appear to be tracked, nor is there a focus on analytic information about the formation of businesses to provide a consolidated view of the level of filing occurring through the site.</li><li><strong>Integrated granular Authentication/Authorization processes lacking.</strong> While the Kansas Business Center does have its own registration and sign-on process, it appears that there are levels of transactions that either could be added to the KBC, or already exist there, that could benefit from a higher level of proof of identity. At present, the custom sign-on provides only one basic level of credentials, which could be a constraint moving forward to expand the number and type of transactions included. It is also not clear that the ability to delegate authorization to perform transactions is available, or that the authentication for the site could be easily ported to services at other agencies or the local level.</li><li><strong>Web Services lacking.</strong>  From the outside, it is not clear whether or not the applications are making use of web services. Other than for interaction with a payment engine, there do not appear to be any published application programming interface standards (SOAP, REST) for third parties to “mash up” or interact with publicly available data captured or created as part of the operation of the KBC, nor does this technology appear to be delivered in a way for other government organizations (vertical, horizontal) to “plug-in” to the KBC functionality.</li></ul>
<h1></h1><h1>Functional and Technical Implications</h1><p>The discussion above outlines deficiencies along with areas for improvement in the current Kansas Business Center. In reviewing both its technical and functional dimensions, the following components were identified as significant needs to be met in any “next generation” solution. </p>
<h2>Single Sign-on</h2><p><strong>Single Sign-on mechanism, supported by a “many-to-many” capability for delegation of transaction authorization.</strong></p>
<p>One common issue facing business one-stop initiatives like the Kansas Business Center is the need to overcome silos in the organization of government services. Chief among them is that of the separate username and password required by each government organization, and usually for each application made use of by a business filer. In the case of the Kansas Business Center, and in business filing in general, this is especially problematic because the interactions with government – while they may be undertaken by individual entrepreneurs and business owners – are just as likely to be executed by third party intermediaries like accountants, attorneys, or even in bulk by national service bureaus. In turn, within each of these organizations, there may be several levels of delegation.</p>
<p>Because of this, while a single sign-on concept is helpful, this needs to be further expanded to ensure that authorization can be appropriately delegated (the need and wisdom of revocation capability should be evaluated) to agents. This “many-to-many” example - common to state and local governments - is illustrated in a diagram taken from a recent State of Indiana (June 2013) Request for Information (14-010) shown below. In this case, SOS is analogous to the Kansas Secretary of State, DWD – Department of Workforce Development to the Kansas Department of Labor, and DOR – Department of Revenue to the Kansas Department of Revenue. While there may be nuance to the arrangement of particular business services and their delivery across units of government in each state, the issue of single sign-on and delegation of authorization remains. Use of the State of Indiana diagram is intended to emphasize how universal this requirement is. The level of authentication required across agencies may vary, so thetechnology used must support “step up” authentication to accommodate the level of proof of identity required. </p>
<p><em>[See</em> <a href="http://www.in.gov/idoa/proc/bids/rfi-14-010/">http://www.in.gov/idoa/proc/bids/rfi-14-010/</a> <em>for State of Indiana Business One-Stop RFI]</em></p>
<h2>Shared Common Business Registration Data</h2><p><strong>Method of sharing “Common Business Registration” data between government organizations involved in registration and licensing. This may also be coupled with a “unique business identifier” that can be used to identify businesses across systems.</strong>	</p>
<p>Another issue that increases drag on entrepreneurs seeking to negotiate the process of forming a business is the frequent requirement – again, due to the silo’d nature of government organizations and supporting computer systems – for reentry of common data during the application process. This not only works against efficiency, but introduces an increased risk of mistyping and data integrity problems.</p>
<p>The state needs to define the requirements for this base set of data, which will require finalizing the scope of the project in terms of which organizations and transactions will be included in the Kansas Business Center. Further technical discussions in this area are also needed, as it appears that there is neither a technical architecture currently in place at the State of Kansas that has been formally established for use in data sharing, nor have data sharing standards been established which could be taken advantage of by this project. That said, the technologies are available and in place in other states that could be used to share a base set of data related to business formation and licensing in the state.</p>
<p>The approach of making use of a unique business identifier across systems has been made use of in several states (State of Nevada, for example) where the Secretary of State’s office is charged with establishing and maintaining it. Other approaches are also used. The Commonwealth of Kentucky, for example, signed a bill (HB 343) into law in March of this yearcharging their One-Stop Business Portal Advisory Committee with establishing a system to consolidate such numbering.</p>
<h2>Standards-based Componentized Architecture</h2><p><strong>A “componentized functional and technical approach that other state and local organizations can “plug-in” to without major integration work.</strong></p>
<p>Both issues (A, B) highlighted in the immediately preceding text are challenges that stem from the way in which government is organized, along with the systems that support its activities. Because it would be an almost insurmountable challenge to move to a common system for all business registration in the state, certainly not in the mid-term, it is inevitable that agency systems will need to be allowed to have several tiers of ways in which they might interoperate with the new Kansas Business Center. However, because no formal agreement on scope has been established, and no inventory has been conducted of potential target systems that would need to interoperate with the KBC, it is very difficult to proscribe specific requirements for the integration techniques and levels that would need to be provided.</p>
<p>Because of this, it appears that an incremental approach, based on standards and designed to be loosely coupled using web services seems advisable. And, as outlined in theNext Steps and Recommendations section, it also appears prudent to limit the scope of the initial rollout to those agencies and systems involved in new business formation, with the idea that the architecture developed could serve as a model for future integration.</p>
<h2>Account System and Dashboard Function</h2><p><strong>“MyAccount” functionality that aggregates transactions, reporting, filing, and other relevant information for users.</strong></p>
<p>One common point of agreement between state agencies and businesses involved in the business formation and filing process is the value of a single user-managed account function that aggregates – either directly or by reference through hyperlinks - information about transactions related to a particular business, copies of filings, notifications about activities performed (for convenience and to assist in early detection of fraud), and relevant upcoming deadlines (annual report due date, for example). This account management function would also include profile information about an individual, including mailing and email address. Payment methods and related information might be maintained here, or at least set up to be quickly accessed from this location. Functionality could also be included to incorporate links to other common used services. Over time, such functionality could be extended to provide other services to customers. It should be noted that the information to be aggregated in terms ofbusiness registrations and reports may often be public**. Therefore, a design decision will need to be as to whether or not an individual user may aggregate and track ANY business, rather than only those in which they hold some interest or formal relationship.** </p>
<h2></h2><h2>Enable Secondary Uses of Data</h2><p><strong>An information and technical architecture that anticipates secondary uses of data (“Data</strong> <strong>Emissions”) generated from transactions and captures and exposes data for reuse.</strong></p>
<p>As noted earlier in this report, data about the transactions carried out through an expanded Kansas Business Center can have value for a variety of purposes, from improving the service delivered by the site, to fueling policy analysis related to economic development, to secondary uses by third parties in mash ups. While interviews with policy makers and potential users can help develop the foundation for the type of data to be collected, the architecture of the site should be designed in such a way as to make data available to the appropriate users in a timely and reusable (standards-based) fashion. </p>
<h1><strong>PART III:</strong> <strong>The State</strong> <strong>Business Center Landscape</strong></h1><p>Outreach and Analysis of Other State Business Centers</p>
<p>The efforts undertaken by the State of Kansas to improve the ease of startup and filing processes for businesses mirror similarly focused efforts at the state-level nationally. While a comprehensive review of the status and success of these projects is beyond the scope of this report, this section provides a brief look at some of the approaches that other states have taken. The information comes primarily from two sources:</p>
<ul><li>Interviews conducted by staff from the Kansas Secretary of State’s office (and, discussion held earlier this spring, with representation from the Kansas Office of Information Technology Services) with other states who deployed or are currently in the process of deploying solutions with a similar focus to that of the Kansas Business Center.</li><li>A cursory review of other state business portals and supporting materials that can be found online, including reports and project planning documents that provide insight into their efforts. Especially helpful was an appendix from a December 2011 report produced by the Commonwealth of Kentucky titled “Innovation in Government: The Kentucky One-Stop Business Portal Assessment” (see: <a href="http://onestop.ky.gov/SiteCollectionDocuments/Kentucky%20Business%20One%20Stop%20Portal%20Final%20Assessment.pdf">http://onestop.ky.gov/SiteCollectionDocuments/Kentucky%20Business%20One%20Stop%20Portal%20Final%20Assessment.pdf</a>) The appendix in the Kentucky report “Appendix D: Inventory of States – Websites” was characterized in that report as follows: </li></ul>
<p><em>The below chart details an exercise by the Kentucky Business One Stop website team where they reviewed all state’s website and determined if the state had a Business One Stop website, its operability and available components. Based on this analysis, Kentucky is now one of twelve states with a functional Business One Stop website.</em></p>
<p>While this work should not be considered definitive, it does provide a convenient listing of the sites that were identified at that time that could be used by the INK Board or the state in conducting further analysis. The report also contains another appendix, “Appendix G: Technical Survey of States with a Business One Stop Service”, which catalogs more detailed information about technical aspects of three one-stop projects in Ohio, Michigan, and Virginia. We reviewed this survey as part of our analysis and used it as a partial basis for the questions used in interviews conducted in the step that follows.</p>
<h2>Interviewswith other States</h2><p>The size and complexity of the scope for business registration and filing projects varies across states, as does the cost, duration, and approaches to development and implementation. Therefore, by definition, this selection is not comprehensive. In addition, each state environment has many unique dimensions. Examples include:</p>
<ul><li>The size and diversity of the business community and economic climate; </li><li>legislative interest, support, and available funding;</li><li>the strategic emphasis placed on the effort by the Governor and other elected officials; </li><li>the sophistication of the state’s technology environment and resources available from competing projects; and</li><li>the history and relative success of the efforts in this area made to-date. </li></ul>
<p>Therefore, without a deep study of each project, lessons can only truly be learned at a high-level and the primary focus of this exercise was considered by the team to be one of sizing the appropriate project scope and developing some understanding of the potential resources (people, technology, funding) required and the risks involved, as well as where innovation might be occurring.</p>
<p>The four states that were interviewed directly were Nevada, Oregon, Indiana, and Washington. The list below provides a general outline of the type of questions asked during the interviews, followed by sections summarizing the information obtained:</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ol><li>How was the project sponsored/led? </li><li>How is governance for the project, and for ongoing operations, handled?</li><li>What did the effort cost overall (estimated)? – internal and external (and, if external, which vendors/pieces)</li><li>What was the length of project and how was it phased?</li><li>Was the software solution custom built, commercial off-the-shelf, or a combination?</li><li>How did you handle any procurements – like, one big one to start (package with consulting) or serially?</li><li>How is maintenance and support for the solution handled (contracted or in-house?) What are the costs associated with that (estimated)?</li><li>Method of integration/degree of integration of processes between agencies, if any?  Like, did agencies redesign/reengineer processes to participate, and, if so, to what degree?</li><li>How is Identity handled? (Single sign on, federated identity, other?)</li><li>Analytics / Information “Exhaust” (analytics, reporting and byproducts) – Open Data, Data Reuse (if any)</li><li>What advice do you have in terms of Lessons Learned/Issues/Challenges</li><li>Future plans/current related initiative – what are you planning or working on now re: one-stop initiatives?</li><li> How satisfied would you say your customers were?</li><li> What kind of transaction volume does your website have?</li><li>For those services that are offered, are they also offered on paper/offline? What kind of increase have you seen in online adoption in those services with the advent of the new one-stop website?</li><li> How do you support the site/services? That is, are questions handled by a third-party, a central help desk, by agencies, who are responsible for a particular type of transaction, etc.? Are the costs of this support included in the costs discussed previously?</li></ol>
<h3>State of Nevada</h3><p>Nevada’s business one-stop portal initiative has been implemented. The service is delivered through a website branded <em>SilverFlume</em> (<a href="https://www.nvsilverflume.gov/">https://www.nvsilverflume.gov/</a>). The principals interviewed were able to provide a good history of the efforts surrounding the site. The_SilverFlume_ initiative was led by the Secretary of State who worked with Nevada’s legislature to pass NRS 75A.100, et.seq that charge the Secretary with establishing a state business portal, along with the standards and requirements to support it (See <a href="http://legiscan.com/NV/bill/AB63/2013">http://legiscan.com/NV/bill/AB63/2013</a>). The initial effort to build the business one-stop was driven by outreach to the business community via focus groups to understand their needs. The Secretary of State’s office then partnered with the state Taxation agency and made use of an RFP that was developed with a consultant to contract with CapGemini to build the site. The RFP phase went from November 2009 through June of 2010 (7 months), with the implementation project running from July 2010 through October 2011 (15 months) until the vendor was deemed unsuccessful in implementing the project. The state took over the project and implemented it using an agile methodology over the following seven (7) months, going live in June 2012. The original budget of the project was around $6.5M, with the state implementing the system using about $375K of remaining budget.</p>
<p>The site primarily automates the business formation process, although the overarching goal of the site is to provide integration with other state agencies and local government. As a basic building block, the state has established a set of Common Business Registration (CBR) data and also a common identifier across agencies for each business. At present, two of the three conceptual “tiers” of integration are available – the first is very basic, where another agency makes use of the information in the system to print and attach the page containing the common information to the front of another agency form as input to avoid duplication. The second enables an agency to take a data feed of this information via web service. The third, just now being developed, would be to integrate local government or other parties into the wizard and processes related to the site.</p>
<p>Priorities on initiatives for day-to-day operations are set by the Secretary of State’s office, where support for <em>SilverFlume</em> has been set up as its own division. Agencies participate in governance as it relates to their data and functions. They noted during the interview that, to some extent, prioritization was driven by statutory deadlines for changes. The technical solution is a custom one built on Oracle using standard interfaces. During the project, it was intended that Oracle’s Identity Management tool would be leveraged, but due to obstacles, the system does not use this. Instead, “quasi-federated” identity is enabled via linkages across Oracle databases. The current plan is to subscribeto the statewide enterprise Identity Management (IDM) solution when it becomes available because “true SSO is a gap” in the current system. Analytics were also initially handled through a purchase of an Oracle Business Intelligence tool, but obstacles encountered resulted in a move to custom web-based reports to pull cross-agency statistics captured by the <em>SilverFlume</em> solution. The technical solution supporting <em>SilverFlume</em> is hosted at the central state IT facility. Ongoing maintenance and new development for <em>SilverFlume</em> is handled by three internal technical and functional staff, two contract developers, and a contract for DBA services. Including ongoing annual software licensing of $300K, the total budget for operations is about $1M per year.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned.</strong> In our interview with the Nevada Secretary of State’s office, they offered several lessons learned from the project.  </p>
<ul><li>Lay out your project to power the highest business value/lowest complexity features first.</li><li>They chose to focus on a subset of agencies, as priorities and sponsors change over time in a political environment – seemed best to “take small bites”.</li><li>Focus on short sprints or release cycles to introduce new high-business value features on a regular, near-term basis.</li><li>Where there is an important business objective, don’t let stakeholders of existing legacy business processes and systems talk you out of pursuing the vision (“it can’t be done” often equals “I don’t know how.”)</li><li>Make sure that executives have access to change management training and tools, and be prepared to support all stakeholders with training and other support to weather the change.</li></ul>
<p>Two notable features of the <em>SilverFlume</em> initiative are also worth highlighting. First is their focus on delivery of web-based training on how to make use of the service. The training is delivered via video and documentation available for download and hosted at <a href="http://www.box.com">www.box.com</a>. The aspect is their customer survey process, where they have contacted over 8,000 users from the business community to measure their satisfaction with the site and services. They reported that the initial number of those finding it difficult to use was 11% - in a subsequent survey this shrunk to 8%.</p>
<h3>State of Washington</h3><p>The State of Washington has made several attempts at developing a Business One-Stop and their current project is in the startup phase. In the last legislative session, they requested an appropriation for the project (over $8M) that was not approved. As a consequence, they are likely to proceed with a more incremental approach going forward. However, it is not yet clear specifically what options – or their associated costs – will be pursued. TheStateCIO’s office is charged by Executive Order 12-01 (January 2012) and by statute (SB 5718), with leading and reporting on the effort. In testimony this spring, a proponent stated that there were 1,377 licenses, inspections, and permits needed to form and conduct the full range of businesses in the state.</p>
<p>The current effort is just now underway, so some of the characterizations made in the interview were informal and involved “thinking out loud” on future direction. A prototype has been created and was recently demonstrated to a steering committee that has been established. Washington, too, has contacted other states to learn more about the approaches being used. From this survey, they found wide variation, from large, expensive projects that attempted to achieve the One-Stop vision of full integration that “knows who you are” and takes a user through the entire business formation and licensing process, to sites that consisted predominantly of inventories of hyperlinks to other websites.</p>
<p>In their effort, there remain questions about what data will stay at their Department of Revenue or Secretary of State’s office, and what will “live in the middle tier”. The concept would be for there to be some type of shared business profile, with a shared authentication system, while the authorization levels for specific access reside in the individual agency systems. An outline of the general project approach is included in the November 2012 report titled “_MyAccount - Streamlining Business Transactions with Government_” (See: http://www.ofm.wa.gov/ocio/documents/MyAccount_report.pdf_‎_).</p>
<p>This report is an outcome of a requirement in the Governor’s Executive Order cited above for the state CIO to “collaborate with the agencies and small business community to develop a high-level enterprise architecture design and implementation plan for an integrated online system by September 30, 2012” (later extended to November 15, 2012). </p>
<p>The 15-page report, developed over 10 months in partnership with eight state agencies, recommends a phased approach. The recommended governance would be led by the Department of Revenue with an executive sponsor from the Governor’s office assigned to “remove roadblocks and hold the lead and other participating agencies accountable for making regular progress.” In the original (not fully funded) plan, <strong>Phase 1**involves implementation of “MyAccount”, a common platform/backbone that enables single sign-on. The process would run concurrently with upgrade projects on existing systems and agencies would be “loosely coupled” to the backbone. A portal with a shared business profile would also be part of this first phase. The agencies to be included were the core agencies for business formation, along with a consolidated licensing agency (Business Licensing Service).**This phase of the project was estimated to cost $7-$8M and be operational in three years (2015).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phase 2</strong> of the project was to upgrade and modernize existing core systems – in this case, two major areas, Business Licensing and Department of Labor and Industry, along with improvements to the Business Portal and the Secretary of State’s Corporate Registration process, with an overall estimated completion in 2015 at a combined cost of $14-$15M. <strong>Phase 3</strong> is stated somewhat indefinitely and involves expanding the services to include “additional jurisdictions and business activities” to include localities and broader permitting, as well as mobile access.</p>
<p>From our discussion with a representative of the State of Washington’s CIO office, it appears that the state already has in place a statewide authentication service based on IBM Tivoli. Most of the “tenant” agencies participate in this, except for the BLS, who will be upgrading to the most recent version. Also, the state has had in place what they term a “Universal Business Identifier” for a number of years – a common number used to refer to a business across agencies and consider this a necessary piece to achieve success. There is some question about the potential to make use of North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes in the system to identify the specific nature of the participating businesses as well in ways that could drive the provision of additional information and services. They are still looking at potential software solutions, and there are questions about whether or not some agencies may even require a sign-on from the user. At this point, it appears that an agile, incremental approach to build-out is going to bethe most successful approach. They observed that a content management system may be an integral part of the solution, noting the capabilities of several open source systems (Joomla, Drupal) and that the approach will likely be structured to support a distributed approach to content management related to the site where agencies manage their own content resources. Finally, from a project administration vantage point, they have set up a collaborative SharePoint site to share documents and status about the project and feel it has been very helpful given the distributed nature of the parties involved in the project. At the end of the conversation, they expressed interest in creating some type of best practice (and perhaps code) -sharing group across states who are involved in these efforts, given that some are just starting, and others appear to be at the stage where they are ready to go through a first round of upgrade.</p>
<h3>State of Oregon</h3><p>Interviews with the Oregon Secretary of State’s office showed that their approach to a business “one-stop” is really divided into two parts.  </p>
<p><strong>Part I:</strong> The newest - and award-winning – part is called <strong>_Business Xpress_</strong>. This site, located at <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/business/">http://www.oregon.gov/business/</a>, is considered the central gateway and navigation aid to “resources for starting, expanding and operating a business in Oregon or relocating a business within or to Oregon.” The <em>Business Xpress</em> site was built as an outcome of an effort led by the Oregon Secretary of State. In 2011, legislation was passed (HB 3247) that established the Secretary of State as the responsible party for implementation of the site. The legislation directs “all agencies of state and local government that have functions related to business registration, licensing, permitting or taxation (along with business relocation) <em>to cooperate with and assist in executing these duties</em>.” The bill also outlined the scope and functions of the site, which made the success factors clear. They began work with a core set of nine agencies by prototyping, then reached out to the business community. The overall effort from design through implementation took about 11 months (August 2011 prototype, October 2011 kickoff, June 2012 go-live). The total cost for the project was $485K. It was built by the Oregon affiliate of the National Information Consortium.The site was built in Microsoft SharePoint 2010 and incorporates responsive design using CSS3 and HTML5 technologies and won awards from both Computerworld and the National Association of Chief Information Officers (NASCIO). In summary, this site is really a navigation guide that links to other resources, including the Central Business Registry below.</p>
<p><strong>Part II.</strong>  While the most recent and most visible activity was around <em>Business Xpress</em>, since 2006 Oregon has had an online <strong>_Central Business Registry_</strong> (CBR) – a list of services included is provided at: <a href="http://www.filinginoregon.com/cbr/services.htm">http://www.filinginoregon.com/cbr/services.htm</a> - and includes those agencies who are part of the Business Formation process. This site is linked to from_Business Xpress_, but is not integrated with it. The CBR began in 2004 with implementing the DBA (doing business as) application out of the Secretary of State’s office, expanding incrementally to add the taxation and employment agency functionality (their Department of Revenue andtheir Employment Department). The expansion phase occurred between April 2007 and February 2008. While there were challenges related to data sharing across agencies, legislation was passed to allow sharing of specific data elements related to business registration. Governance was established in the form of a committee to oversee the effort composed of a technical executive manager and one business leader from each of the participating agencies, with one vote given to each agency. Technology and security standards were developed by a separate technical committee composed of agency technical experts that reported in to a project team made up of project managers from each agency involved, overseen by an enterprise project manager responsible for the overall project (Source: NASCIO 2006 Award Nomination). </p>
<p>The project made use of web services to exchange needed information, following the principle that agencies should not have to reengineer processes or develop new systems to participate. The system was built using Oracle, with Oracle Identity Manager as a shared sign-on solution. Upon submission, there is a workflow engine with rules that route the document for approvals. Theymake use of APIs in this system.</p>
<p>One lesson learned related to an upgrade the system is currently undergoing to change approach to more of a “hub and spoke” architecture, so that things are less tightly coupled. The problem they ran into with the tightly integrated approach is that there were conflicting timelines and schedules across the participants for when changes needed to be done (driven by statute, say, for something to be in at the beginning of a fiscal year, vs. that being a busy time for another agency that had no resources to devote to testing). The new approach will allow agencies to only have to deal with changes that affect them. In addition, the CBR architecture is such that minimal data is kept in a shared layer. If a user wants to pull up a record of previous activity, it is retrieved from the existing agency systems.</p>
<p>The project has its own help desk and has actually included features in the application that help the staff address issues, like a button that can be used to survey their PC.</p>
<p>In nominating the project for a NASCIO award, the State highlighted the following success factors:</p>
<ul><li>The ability to quickly obtain critical but vital legislation; </li><li>Strong executive management support and sponsorship for all participants; </li><li>Steering committee commitment with involvement in crucial roles by the necessary people; </li><li>Strong common vision, scope and methodology; </li><li>Strong project discipline without rigidity; </li><li>Sole executive sponsorship; </li><li>A small but empowered number of participants from each agency. Each agency participant must be empowered to make binding decisions on behalf of their respective agency. </li></ul>
<h3></h3><h3>State of Indiana </h3><p>The Indiana Secretary of State’s office is leading a multi-agency project to implement a business one-stop portal based on legislation (HB 1006) passed in 2011. The legislation directs all state agencies to participate in the maintenance and development of the site at the request of the Secretary of State. The project is focused on business formation (set up of the business entity, prior to taking the step to identify and perform the transactions necessary to engage in a particular type of business). As a result, the steering committee is made up of representatives from the Governor’s office, the Secretary of State’s office, the Department of Revenue, the Department of Workforce Development, and the Indiana Office of Technology (central IT). Indiana focused on business formation because it touched the highest percentage of businesses. </p>
<p>The requirements gathering, communication, and RFI/RFP process is being supported by a consulting firm, Baker Tilly, who worked with the state to develop requirements, the project charter andthe RFI and RFP at a cost roughly in the $500K-$800K range. A Request for Information (RFI) was released and responded to in the summer and a Request for Proposal is scheduled to be posted in mid-October 2013. From a technical perspective, the approach has not yet been decided on. However, the state does not have enterprise single sign-on, and the project executive feels that this technology will be a central key to success. There is not a common business identifier in use across agencies yet, but some way to address that issue is expected as an outcome of the project. Based on a review of the RFI’s and previous research, it seems unlikely that a commercial off-the-shelf product will meet the needs of the state. They will try to leverage existing systems as much as possible and not build new ones. One goal in this initiative that was emphasized is to assure that functionality is delivered in chunks to mitigate risk as there was a previous initiative in this area that was led by the central technology office that was not successful. They perceive there to be a line beyond which bringing in additional functionality dramatically increases the risk of failure and include a list of 10 risks and their mitigation strategies in the Project Charter.</p>
<p>A review of the RFI documents shows the following expectations about the duration of the project after the project charter and roadmap were complete: RFI and Requirements Gathering (3-4 months); RFP Development, Vendor Evaluation and Selections (2-4 months); Solution Development and Initial Implementation (9-15 months) for an overall project duration of 14-23 months. Including time to organize the project (3-4 months), the window appears to be 18-24 months. The roadmap included in the charter envisions tiers – described as “horizons” - of functionality across the three agencies involved in business formation, and provide justification for the prioritization of what is included in each.</p>
<h1><strong>PART IV:</strong> <strong>The</strong> <strong>Innovation</strong> **Landscape </h1><p>The following new factors and opportunities emerging in the broader environment can be leveraged directly or as design patterns for Kansas Business Center:</p>
<h2>Changing Environment</h2><p>In today’s world, constant innovation in service delivery is a given. Nowhere is that more true than with technology. In the five years since the Kansas Business Center last underwent renovation (2008), a lot has happened. Mobile technology is quickly removing to replace the standard desktop or laptop. The first Android-powered phone was released that fall, and the iPhone, released in 2007 would go on to sell millions handsets and transform the way citizens communicate. In turn, the first iPad didn’t appear until 2010, but sold at three times the rate of the iPhone per quarter. There was not yet a Bing, Instagram, or Pinterest. Barriers to funding and entry to online startups have fallen (Kickstarter, Indiegogo). There is an increased focus on the value of data - Big Data and Open Data have become mainstream during this period, and now personal data (Quantified Self) is on its way to becoming the “new asset class” (Pentland, 2008).</p>
<p>With so many changes occurring in the private sector, and the increasing influence of consumer technology in shaping both business and government service delivery, it is important that the State adopt an approach that prizes flexibility and loosely-coupled technology that can fit in the growing “API economy”, where government technology works as a “platform” (O’Reilly, 2010) for innovation, allowing entrepreneurs to build on top of data and services to meet public needs. An approach focused on lightweight integration of systems and data sharing also opens up government for improved data-based policy making that improves efficiency and delivers more effective and responsive services.</p>
<p>This section of the report takes a look at several trends and technologies that should be considered by the Information Network of Kansas and its partners in deciding on both an approach to the next generation Kansas Business Center and to maintaining its lead as a government innovator.</p>
<h2>Trends and Technologies</h2><p><strong>API Economy</strong></p>
<p>The term API, or <strong>Application Programming Interface</strong>, has been in use for a number of years. API specifications standardize the way that software interoperates. And, increasingly, across system and organizational boundaries, allows different applications to make use of services and data, creating the potential to combine them in new ways to create new public/private services. Private industry is rapidly adopting and incorporating Open APIs to innovate, and this effort is extending now to the federal government (see API directory at:<a href="http://www.data.gov/developers/page/developer-resources">http://www.data.gov/developers/page/developer-resources#individual</a> and article “The Recent Rise of Government APIs at:  <a href="http://bit.ly/14gy14y">http://bit.ly/14gy14y</a>).  <strong>Representational State Transfer (REST) interfaces</strong> are growing in adoption. Such “RESTful endpoints” allow data to be pulled by external applications to fuel re-presentation and combination of data. One Kansas example is the_Kansas Legislative Information System and Services (KLISS)_application, winner of the 2012 National Association of Chief Information Officers Open Government (NASCIO) award. The KLISS RESTian Interface Guide (v7.0, 2012) provides 50-pages of instructions and formats for entrepreneurs who would like to integrate this open data into their applications. There are many creative ways government information can be exposed and used – imagine the possibilities for the API released just this spring by the USDA that catalogs Farmer’s Markets:<a href="http://blogs.usda.gov/2013/05/15/new-api-helps-satisfy-the-nations-app-etite-for-farmers-markets/">http://blogs.usda.gov/2013/05/15/new-api-helps-satisfy-the-nations-app-etite-for-farmers-markets/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media and Networking</strong></p>
<p>The huge growth in Social Media use by the public and government is not new, but growth in this area of innovation remains strong. According to the Social Media Directory located on the state portal (<a href="http://www.kansas.gov/media-center/social-media/">http://www.kansas.gov/media-center/social-media/</a>), over 30 state organizations participate in social media services like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. While a cursory review appears to indicate they are mostly used for one-way posting of information, with some communication, the use of Social Media by government in Economic Development efforts like the Kansas Business Center seems like an area ripe for progress, where information about Kansas markets, economic development funding, commercial building sites and related services can converge into a platform that can support a forum for business interaction with government and community economic development resources. While to some extent this is currently being accomplished by Network Kansas, a tighter integration could be built and extended in this area.</p>
<p><strong>Social Log-in: Consumer-focused Federated Identity</strong></p>
<p>The last three years has seen large gains in the use of “social” logins and identity – from social media sites, like Facebook, Twitter, or search engines like Google – as federated logins, with a single sign-on from one of these providers accepted across multiple websites. While this technology is still maturing, the concept of social login has a myriad of potential uses – to enable simple tasks like signing up for notifications, to commenting on draft publications or providing feedback on government services. Using technologies like OAuth2 and OpenID Connect can enable sharing of user attributes between sites that, in time, may be useful as a base for sharing user registration data across both public and private partners. The idea of federated identity is being actively explored across government and industry:</p>
<ul><li><strong>MyUSA (formerly MyGov).</strong> [http://presidential-innovation-fellows.github.io/mygov/ ] The federal government <em>Presidential Innovation Fellows</em> program (see more below), with a team member from the National Information Consortium (the Kansas Information Consortium’s parent company) recently demonstrated a MyUSA federated identity that could be used by citizens as a common login to share basic information across federal websites.</li><li><strong>National Strategy for Trusted Identity in Cyberspace (NSTIC) and IDESG grants.</strong>  <a href="http://www.nist.gov/nstic/">[http://www.nist.gov/nstic/</a>] The federal government has implemented a national strategy for allowing the use of federated identity for interoperable credentials in the name of increased security and economic development. The grant program is continuing to exploreoptions through a pilot program, and federal agencies – such as the United States Postal Service – are pursuing novel approaches like the _Federal Cloud Credential Exchange (FCCX)_that would work across the federal government and private sector. While this is a complex area to navigate, the rewards of simplifying and standardizing credentials are great. The Identity Ecosystem Steering Group (IDESG)<a href="http://www.idecosystem.org/group/leadership">http://www.idecosystem.org/group/leadership</a>  - a private sector group established by NSTIC to support the strategy - has a broad membership across industry and continues to work to expand the capabilities of federated identity technologies. As the Information Network of Kansas considers their role in enabling citizens to overcome the barrier of additional usernames and passwords (on average of 7 passwords across 25 websites per citizen - Florencio, D., &amp; Herley, C., 2007) to ease government interaction, INK should actively explore these solutions for use with state government services and the Kansas Business Center. More information on this topic is included in the Next Steps and Recommendations and section of this report.</li></ul>
<p>**Open Data</p>
<p>Across the world, there has been an explosion of interest in publishing government data in machine-readable format as an aid to accountability and economic development. A number of states have created sites along the lines of the federal Data.gov website (<a href="http://www.data.gov">www.data.gov</a>). The President recently issued an executive order titled “Making Machine Readable Data the New Default for Government Information” <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-">http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-</a>that reinforces this direction at the federal level. Internationally, the Open Knowledge Foundation has created**CKAN** – Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network - <a href="http://ckan.org/">http://ckan.org/</a>) open source data portal software that can be used to host and deliver government open data. Software from private sector companies such as Socrata <a href="http://www.socrata.com/">http://www.socrata.com/</a> are used by many jurisdictions to deliver open data. </p>
<p>**Personal Data Service**The last few years has seen increasing concern related to privacy and reuse of personal data, as well as its potential as a “new asset class” (Pentland, 2008) that can improve efficiency and generate wealth. Commercial companies, such as </p>
<p><em>MyDex</em> (<a href="http://mydex.org/">http://mydex.org/</a>) and <em>Personal</em> (<a href="http://www.personal.com/">http://www.personal.com/</a>) have risen up to provide secure individual data stores which can be used to hold and protect individual data, as well as to control rules for both active and passive submission and sharing of such data. While the technology and concepts are relatively new, they are already being tested by government (see <a href="http://mydex.org/prototype/whos-involved/">http://mydex.org/prototype/whos-involved/</a>).   The MIT open source model for personal data services is called openPDS and is described at <a href="http://openpds.media.mit.edu">http://openpds.media.mit.edu</a>. Many more companies and public sector initiatives abound in this space as well. The Personal Data Ecology Consortium (PDEC) provides a key venue for relevant organization that are innovating in this field. More information on PDEC is available at:<a href="http://pde.cc">http://pde.cc</a> </p>
<p><strong>Predictive Analytics</strong></p>
<p>The rise of “Big Data” has been accompanied by an emphasis on predictive analytics, that is, making use of data mining and statistical techniques to enhance planning, policy making, and responsiveness based on modeling of a wide swath of government service, including pattern detection in crime in general, fraud, and risk management. It can include matching resources invested in service delivery channels to planned volume and timing, or assist in identifying emerging problems in infrastructure, security, resource consumption, or health. In the case of the Kansas Business Center, patterns in activity can be mined. For example, the <em>Indicators of the Kansas Economy</em> application proposed by Kansas, Inc. in the 2007 Kansas Economic Development Strategic Plan identifies the needs for “a single source of objective and consistent information that allows public and private leadership, as well as all interested Kansans to better understand the economy and enhance decision-making capacity.” (<a href="http://www.kansasinc.org/pubs/working/2007StrategicPlan.pdf">http://www.kansasinc.org/pubs/working/2007StrategicPlan.pdf</a>) Viewing potential Kansas Business Center analytics from this vantage point can help identify specific contributions that can be architected into a solution.</p>
<p><strong>Tech-enabled Civic (and Organizational) Engagement</strong> </p>
<p>As part of the “Civic Startup” movement referenced below, a number of tools have come together to solicit “**crowdsourced**” forms of citizen input, attempting to take advantage of the <em>Wisdom of Crowds</em>(Surowiecki, 2004) – where science is showing that decisions or ideas that are developed through the aggregation of group input, rather than by individuals, are often more effective policy solutions. Ideascale (<a href="http://www.ideascale.com">www.ideascale.com</a>) has been used successfully by the federal government, as well as by states to crowdsource idea generating and ranking for policy suggestions and potential alternative solutions to public challenges – Google Moderator (<a href="http://www.google.com/moderator/">http://www.google.com/moderator/</a>) allows the posting of questions and responses, where software like Crowdbrite (<a href="http://www.crowdbrite.com">www.crowdbrite.com</a>) supports collaborative brainstorming. These types of approaches are growing in use in the municipal environment, but their applicability is broad, including internal to government, across governments, and with private or nonprofit partners.**Wiki Government**(Noveck, 2009) details how “looking beyond institutionalized centers of expertise” can help government be more innovative and productive in problem-solving and service delivery. When looking for approaches to the Kansas Business Center (seeAttachments), we engaged Dr. Noveck in identifying those sources, and this report is one result.</p>
<h2>Organizations</h2><p><strong>Gov 3.0</strong></p>
<p>Since the last refresh of the Kansas Business Center, and, especially at the present time, there has been increasing attention on innovation in the delivery of government services through use of Web 2.0/3.0 technologies. The following list is not exhaustive, but provides a brief summary of the types of resources and approaches being used that should be considered in finalizing an approach to scoping and implementation of an enhanced KBC and Information Network of Kansas innovation.</p>
<p><strong>State and Local</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Code for America</strong> (<a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/">http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/</a>) </li></ul>
<p>Code for America is a non-profit that brings together web professionals with municipal government through a fellowship program for the purpose of devising and implementation innovative technology solutions to local problems. They have several programs, one of which has participants working in Kansas City (KCMO and Wyandotte Unified Government), another of which built an application called <em>OpenCounter</em> for the City of Santa Cruz that is focused on permitting for small business startups and is built on open source code (see <a href="http://opencounter.cityofsantacruz.com/">http://opencounter.cityofsantacruz.com/</a>).</p>
<ul><li><strong>New Urban Mechanics</strong> <a href="http://www.newurbanmechanics.org/">http://www.newurbanmechanics.org/</a>)Started as part of the Mayor’s office in Boston and expanded to Philadelphia, the website states that “</li></ul>
<p>this office serves as each City’s innovation incubator, building partnerships between City agencies and outside institutions and entrepreneurs to pilot projects (in Boston) that address resident and business needs.” This “civic incubator” approach, in this case actually attached to city government organizationally, is an example worth investigating for as a source for ideas and methods for improving the Kansas Business Center and the operational model for the Information Network of Kansas. See also<a href="http://openplans.org/">http://openplans.org/</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Federal</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Presidential Innovation Fellows</strong> (<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows">http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows</a>)</li></ul>
<p>From the web site: This program “pairs top innovators from the private sector, non-profits, and academia with top innovators in government to collaborate during focused 6-13 month tours of duty to develop solutions that can save lives, save taxpayer money, and fuel job creation.” The projects are technology-focused and address topics from RFP creation to Open Data. One example relevant to breaking down agency silos is the_MyUSA_ project, a lightweight single sign-on approach across services in the federal government (see <a href="http://presidential-innovation-fellows.github.io/mygov/about/">http://presidential-innovation-fellows.github.io/mygov/about/</a>). (See also above)</p>
<h2>Approaches</h2><ul><li><strong>Hackathons and App Contests.</strong> A get together, usually one day or over a weekend, of software developers for intensive team-oriented development of prototype applications around a particular problem or theme, with the resulting products usually open source, the best of which may gain life as a full development project by the sponsoring party. Recently, there have been a number of hackathons focused on government – for examples, see the <strong>National Day of Civic Hacking</strong> (<a href="http://hackforchange.org/">http://hackforchange.org/</a>), which included state government participants from Maryland, New York, and Nevada; the <strong>International Open Data Hackathon</strong> (<a href="http://opendataday.org/">http://opendataday.org/</a>; and <strong>Apps for Communities</strong> (<a href="http://appsforcommunities.challengepost.com/">http://appsforcommunities.challengepost.com/</a>.</li><li><strong>Idea contests.</strong>  There are a number of contests for ideas on how to solve public problems. This is a method that could be used to fuel brainstorming on innovative tools and techniques that could be of value in reinventing part or all of the Kansas Business Center (or the Information Network of Kansas). One student-focused example with regard to Big Data/Open Data is the University of California at Berkeley’s Big Ideas contest (<a href="http://bigideas.berkeley.edu/contest/opendata/">http://bigideas.berkeley.edu/contest/opendata/</a>). Kansas could look at partnering withlocal (Kauffman Foundation for Entrepreneurship, Kansas State, University of Kansas) or national (New York University, Knight Foundation) organizations to generate attention and ideas that may help shape the direction of technologies and techniques delivered in the new KBC.</li><li><strong>Kauffman Foundation.**The nearby Kaufmann Foundation is heavily invested in strategies to nurture the start up and entrepreneur communities. Their**Kauffman Labs for Enterprise Creation</strong> (<a href="http://www.entrepreneurship.org/en/Kauffman-Labs.aspx">http://www.entrepreneurship.org/en/Kauffman-Labs.aspx</a> ) hosts innovative programs for entrepreneurs like <strong>1 Million Cups</strong> (<a href="http://www.1millioncups.com/">http://www.1millioncups.com/</a>). INK could approach Kauffman to work together to attract public-sector focused startups to bring innovation to Kansas government.</li><li><strong>Knight Foundation.</strong>  This foundation has created an initiative called <em>Tech for Engagement</em> that is focused on funding projects focused on open government and civic engagement. Many of the projects they are interested in have connections to subjects within the scope of the Information Network of Kansas mission. See <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/funding-initiatives/tech-engagement/">http://www.knightfoundation.org/funding-initiatives/tech-engagement/</a>). </li></ul>
<h1>PART V: Identification and Assessment of Alternatives**</h1><p>From a high-level review of other states, many have focused on the <strong>business formation process</strong>, which in Kansas would involve the <strong>Secretary of State’s office</strong>, <strong>Department of Revenue</strong>, and <strong>Department of Labor</strong>– the three agencies necessary to form a business that would have employees. If the business has no employees, formation would not necessarily involve the Department of Labor. By definition, all businesses must pass this “gate” to form a business in Kansas, so focusing on this portion of the process – by necessity – impacts the greatest number of businesses.</p>
<p>In some cases in other states, the “business one-stop” has expanded to include enabling registration and filing for <strong>business type</strong>. While the project budgets generally are in the millions of dollars, the investment required to extend functionality to include registration and licensing for business type with agencies outside the formation process is significantly higher, perhaps multiples of the cost of the former approach.</p>
<p>Thus, the potential approaches to further development of the Kansas Business Center concept lie along a continuum from small investments in the existing KBC to a full, integrated application-drive website that incorporates all business registration and licensing transactions in the state. The level of investment in planning and preparation, staffing, funding, and time required vary proportionately, depending on the level of integration desired and the technological approach chosen to support the process.</p>
<p>This section of the document outlines these decisions at a high-level, with the idea that once a formal project effort has been convened, executive decision makers will provide guidance on which options bear further investigation. Given that the current implementation landscape involves systems and processes that vary in their level of automation and the technologies used, may not be standardized as to requirements (different pieces of information may be named or used differently), may cross both horizontal and vertical boundaries of government, and emphasis on the Kansas Business Center must compete with other program priorities for resources, achieving full online integration of business services is a daunting task. However, regardless of the approach chosen, decision makers should remain focused on the “triple constraint”:</p>
<p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
<p>The number of organizations, and the number and complexity of processes and the systems that support them, to be integrated.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule</strong></p>
<p>The time available to complete the project(s) and begin achieving benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong></p>
<p>The amount of funding for staffing, consulting resources, computer software/hardware, and associated expenses required to develop, maintain, and enhance the solution over time.</p>
<p>The classic dictum in working within the triangle is “pick any two”. “Quick and cheap, for example, often means less scope can be included. While new technologies exist to minimizereengineering by “loosely coupling” systems and processes, they are not a panacea. Longer schedules often increase risk, as more “balls in the air” in terms of changes in the external environment or new, competing priorities could cause delays or rework in the project.</p>
<h3>Scope and Service Alternatives</h3><p>Three options naturally present themselves as a potential scope for the Kansas Business Center project. However, a fourth option is recommended at the conclusion of this section.</p>
<p><strong>Option 1 – Partial State Business Formation</strong></p>
<p>This option entails rewriting existing business registration and filing functions delivered by the Secretary of State as well as potentially those delivered by the Kansas Department of Revenue (the latter were not reviewed as part of this report). This could also take the form of enhancing those services by automating those that are not yet fully online. This functionality could be thought of as building out the existing Kansas Business Center – although the technology and approach could be reinvented – which would allow the completion of all transactions necessary to form a business in Kansas.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This scope might also include work with the federal government to integrate the ability for businesses to obtain a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN) via web services or some other technology without leaving the Kansas Business Center.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2 – Complete State Business Formation</strong></p>
<p>This option is essentially Option 1, but adds the capability to complete those transactions required by the Kansas Department of Labor to form a business that would have employees. From materials available online about previous iterations of the Kansas Business Center, it appears possible that this functionality has been available through the KBC in the past, and it appears to be available on the KDOL website right now as a freestanding service.</p>
<p><strong>Option 3 – Complete</strong> <strong>State Business Formation + Business Type Registration</strong></p>
<p>Include some or all of the parties outlined in <em>Partial State Business Formation or Complete State Business Formation</em> scope along with one or more agencies involved in registration, licensing, or permitting for business type. This could also incorporate one or more processes where the local level of government requires additional registration, licensing, or permitting.</p>
<p>This options bears further discussion. Of course, to register and obtain a permit or license for a particular occupation or “type”, a business must first form a business “entity”. There may also be a significant gap between the time a business is formed and registration and licensing related to a business type applied for and granted. And, while the State of Kansas requires registration and licensing for many categories of businesses – from egg dealers, to pesticide applicators, to auctioneers – registration and licensing may often be required by a city or county as well.</p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this engagement to provide significant analysis of the registration and licensing processes that occur across all categories and occupations at both the state and local level in Kansas in such a manner that would support a decision on what, if any, functionality to include here. The 172-page Network Kansas publication titled “Steps to Success: A Step-by-Step Guide to Starting a Business” (<a href="http://www.networkkansas.com/docs/default-source/ntks-website/steps-to-success.pdf?sfvrsn=0">http://www.networkkansas.com/docs/default-source/ntks-website/steps-to-success.pdf?sfvrsn=0</a>) is illustrative. It provides what isdescribed as a “partial list of common businesses or areas that require registration/licensing/permits with specific agencies/commissions. New businesses should also check with their local city and county clerk to determine if either municipality requires any licenses/permits/zoning requirements.” While this “partial list” also includes professional occupations, <strong>it catalogs over 360 licenses or permits</strong> and repeats the warning that other licensing or permitting may be required at the local level.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation</strong> of these alternatives is difficult to perform without a better understanding of several important criteria that pertain both to the priorities of the state and for addressing the “Triple Constraint” outlined above:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Option 3 Evaluation.</strong> While the state would obviously be interested in Option 3 - for some or all of the state’s business registration processes to be available via a One-Stop - from talking with other states, this option has proven to be very costly – both initially and for ongoing maintenance. It also involves some risk of failure given the complexity and management of resources required while agency operations continue “in flight”, and usually takes significant time to implement. No business case has been developed that shows the payback to the state or business for this investment. Given the diversity of agency systems and boundaries to be overcome and the challenges encountered to-date in improving the existing Kansas Business Center**, Option 3 is not the best choice for scope at the present time given the state’s level of preparation and commitment.**</li></ul>
<ul><li><strong>Evaluation of Option 1 and 2:**The same issues are encountered in trying to evaluate these options – What level of executive support is there for this scope? What kind of cost would be encountered and how willing are the parties to commit? Would the existing Kansas Business Center be built out or a new investment made in developing another website. While recommendations on these choices isaddressed below and in the Next Steps and Recommendations section of the report, **a</strong> <strong>more limited scope such as than</strong> <strong>outlined in Option 1 or 2 is the most appropriate place for the State to start in their reinvention effort.</strong></li></ul>
<h3>The Fourth Option</h3><p>In evaluating next steps for the State, consider the evidence accumulated during the course of this study:</p>
<ul><li>Planning efforts that have been on again, off again with little progress – from conversations with other states, this situation is not unique to Kansas.</li><li>No formal executive committee has existed to oversee or direct efforts to maintain or grow the current Kansas Business Center</li><li>Basic technological building blocks at the enterprise level are missing: single sign-on, published standards or governance for web services or data sharing; resources and priorities are focused on internal improvements that may support greater integration in the future, but are not available now.</li><li>No clear source of dedicated funding of the scale shown to be required by efforts in other states to develop or maintain a fully integrated statewide system</li></ul>
<p>Alternatively, the following capabilities exist:</p>
<ul><li>The State has a willing partner in Network Kansas that has deep experience working with Kansas businesses.</li><li>The Governor’s office has met with and agreed on joint sponsorship of a project to reinvent the Kansas Business Center that would be led by the Secretary of State with the full support of the cabinet and executive branch.</li><li>The INK Board has dedicated seed money totaling $500,000 to the effort to reinvent the Kansas Business Center.</li><li>Centers of expertise exist in some agencies on the development of standardized web services for data sharing between agencies and with external parties.</li><li>A common desire exists across both state agencies involved in business formation and licensing and those businesses to deploy an account management system where </li></ul>
<p>The current vendor for the Information Network of Kansas has worked on implementation of business one-stop projects in other states and can provide assistance in offering a federated ID service for business formation and filing transactions.</p>
<p><strong>Given this situation, the State of Kansas should consider moving forward on two parallel paths, further elaborated in the</strong> <strong>_Next Steps and Recommendations_</strong> <strong>section.</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Path 1:</strong> Deploy Toolbox for Intergovernmental Business Registration and Filing</p>
<p>The state should pursue an incremental approach to build out of registration and licensing functionality by:</p>
<ul><li><strong>REST.</strong> Actively encouraging the development and publishing of standardized web services (REST or other technologies) to allow communication and data exchange between existing systems. Such services can be incrementally developed and implemented between and among agencies as negotiated via small or large cooperative efforts. </li><li><strong>Accommodate filings originating in consumer and business software, service bureaus, and other intermediaries.</strong>  Even more important than encouraging the incremental deployment of interagency web services is <strong>the need to focus on more seamlessly enabling business filings by service bureaus and other intermediaries</strong>(accountants, attorneys, business services firms). Many times, individuals and businesses work with private sector firms that end up using software to create government filings that are, in turn, printed and mailed in for lack of an electronic interface between their software and the state’s electronic filing systems – only to be rekeyed into a state system upon receipt.**Automating services in this area can provide a bottom-line benefit to businesses, citizens, and the state and should be considered an immediate priority for state agencies.**</li><li>**Federated ID.**Deploy federated identification services – through a third-party white label provider, through the Information Network of Kansas, or some other means – including consideration of leveraging existing authentication for the Kansas Department of Revenue business filing – to enable single sign-on for business registration across agencies. Such authentication should support “step-up”, so that those agencies requiring additional authentication can be enabled to do so as part of the functionality.</li><li><strong>Account Management.</strong>  To ease interaction with the state for its business customers, and to encourage timely business filing as well as discourage fraud by activity-triggered notifications, the state should deploy account management services as outlined in the <em>MyAccount Dashboard</em> section of <em>Proposed Use Cases and Requirements</em> above.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Path 2:</strong> Proceed with review and improvements to the existing Kansas Business Center, as well as begin a project to reinvent KBC concepts and service delivery in line with the path above.</p>
<p>Further detail about this path is included in the <em>Next Steps and Recommendations</em> section that follows. Any efforts to implement a more integrated approach to state business formation and business type licensing and permitting should incorporate the concepts above.</p>
<h1><strong>PART VI: Establishing the</strong> <strong>Mission and Success Metrics</strong></h1><p>The INK Board and potentially any stakeholder steering group it may develop to help steward re-design of the Kansas Business Center must establish the authoritative vision, mission, goals and objectives that will guide architecture and operations going forward.  </p>
<p>At a very high level of abstraction, the mission of the Kansas Business Center is impliedly to reduce the obstacles or needless time required for a new business to form in Kansas. But below that very generic policy aim, there are an array of implicit and potentially different potential assumptions about the key mission, goals and objectives intended. While the recommended general direction and conceptual design approach described in this report is of general merit, it cannot substitute for the task of governance and executive judgment and decision-making regarding the destination, path and mode of progress expected. The business practices and models, legal and policy rules as well as the technical or operational processes should explicitly reflect and support success and achievement as duly defined by the decision makers.</p>
<p>As an outgrowth of the analysis performed as part of the environmental scan that is summarized in this report, the team developed a set of proposed goals for the Kansas Business Center.  Next, they developed a set of principles that represent best practices and general criteria that can be used to evaluate options for improvement of the Kansas Business Center in line with those goals.  The following summary of the postulated Goals and corresponding Decision-Making Principles are offered to provide a starting point for the governance and executive management process recommended by this Report.  </p>
<p>Whether the vision, goals and technical solutions approach proposed by this Report are ratified in their entirely, in part or totally replaced with a fresh approach, the most important outcome is that the intended purposes and outcomes for Kansas Business Center be discussed, deliberated and clearly decided. Based upon an agreed high level vision and path, the ultimate selection of methods and mechanisms to achieve the outcomes can be conclusively evaluated and decided. However, the process of exploring and reporting upon high value innovating opportunities now available for use by Kansas Business Center has resulted in a rich set of options for consideration by the decision makers. The assumed vision, mission and outcomes underlying this report and derived from</p>
<h2>Proposed Kansas Business Center Mission and Goals</h2><p>The principal goals of the Kansas Business Center should be:</p>
<ul><li>To enable entrepreneurs to easily identify and quickly complete the filings necessary to form a business in Kansas. </li><li>Once formed, to allow businesses to refer to a single source to maintain and access their filings with the State.</li><li>To increase the accuracy, while reducing data entry, complexity and processing time for the submission of business filings to the State.</li><li>To improve the openness, sharing, and reuse of data about business activity in support of policy making and to further economic development. </li><li></li></ul>
<p>To integrate payment processing and account management for these transactions</p>
<h2></h2><h2>Proposed Decision-making Principles</h2><p>In evaluating the alternative proposed in the following section, the solution approach selected should:</p>
<p><strong>Implement functionality that supports business registration, filing, payments, and ongoing reporting in a way that is as seamless as possible to the end user, so that it:</strong> </p>
<ul><li>Minimizes or eliminates the need for the user to re-enter data across systems and agencies</li><li>“Remembers” the user across organizational boundaries and time</li><li>Allows users access to their own data, as well as exercise fine-grained controls on sharing with both the state and, over time, other parties they choose.</li><li>Amplifies the value of the business identity established as more transactions are conducted</li><li>Incorporates lessons learned and capabilities for ongoing assistance to businesses by Network Kansas.</li><li>Integrate with a common payment system for business registration filing and reporting activities with the State.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Use a technical solution that accommodates the integration of backend agency processes and systems in a way that:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Minimizes up-front investment and ongoing cost</li><li>Is standards-based</li><li>Is secure</li><li>Is stable, scalable, and minimizes technical risks in implementation and support</li><li>Uses a framework of configurable “components” that are reusable and extensible to new processes and agencies</li><li>Allows changes in processes or requirements to be easily implemented and maintained.</li><li>Makes use of open source technology, where appropriate, carefully weighing the cost/benefit of “open code” with the advantages of commercial off-the-shelf software packages and third party hosting that can reduce the complexity and resources required for maintenance.</li><li>New agencies or processes can be added and integrated over time without significant rework, risks.</li><li>Focuses on reducing redundancy and complexity in the current electronic process.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Design the user experience in such a way that:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Mirrors best practices across public and commercial applications</li><li>Portrays transitions across organizational boundaries in government as seamless, both horizontally and vertically</li><li>Leverages private and public sector best practices and incorporates the functionality desired by intermediaries who file and maintain records on behalf of business owners in both batch and individual mode.</li></ul>
<h2>Establishing Production Use Case Requirements and Constraints </h2><p>Establishing detailed requirements, constraints and use cases intended to drive the software code development, integration or configuration of specific technologies is beyond the scope of this Report. However, such detailed decision are necessary at the appropriate moment in the process of re-design for the Kansas Business Center and should be preceded by and aligned with the INK Board’s eventual determination of vision, purpose and goals for the Kansas Business Center. The detailed use cases must also reflect and support a process of negotiated consensus building among all the key stakeholders that will depend upon, operate or otherwise significantly impact or be impacted by the system. Chief among these stakeholders are the Kansas businesses that the system is primarily intended to benefit and second the agencies, departments and other organs of government that will interoperate with and through the system. The detailed functionality for Kansas Business Center improvements and specific requirements from other state agencies or local units of Kansas government is not, therefore, intended to be part of this conceptual design. See the_Next Steps and Recommendations_ section of this report for recommendations on further work to be done in this area. </p>
<h2>Relationship Between Success Metrics, Goals and Data-Driven Systems</h2><p>One important implication of adopting the Web 2.0 approach described in this conceptual design is that it enables easy real-time reporting and automation potential for virtually all business interactions, legal processes and technical operations occurring on or with the Kansas Business Center.  </p>
<p>This is because the architecture calls for careful deployment of "flow event identifiers" at key points across the system. Since the approach calls for an entirely data-driven and web 2.0 implementation, the interposition of standard system logging is not only possible but easily deployed in a uniform manner at all layers and dimensions of the system. Whether a new business has been successfully formed, a server patch installed, a help desk inquiry answered or a user authorization to share data granted, the same type of flow event identifiers can be sensed, secured and stored. Once stored in a standard formatwithin a designated file or data-set, appropriate apps and services can easily be configured to notice, alert, refresh, push, pull, get, put or otherwise triggered to take expected actions. </p>
<p>The activity with external apps and services that are registered as clients with the KBC or to which the KBC is registered as a client would have Flow Event IDs sensing, creating, preserving and communicating activity with the KBC. For example, each time a given app requested access to a protected Profile Attribute, an event would be logged not only to effectuate the first-order permission flow by the user, but also to feed real time management oversight, performance monitoring and later oversight and audit analysis. In addition, the same Flow Event ID can and should be used to feed internal and partner business intelligence, market analysis and trend spotting analytics or in some cases could even trigger payment processes for cost share, revenue share or other consequent or second-order data-driven transactions.</p>
<h3>What to Measure</h3><p>In order to make the best available evaluation of whether desired or expected outcomes intended to result from the KBC have occurred, a set of relevant measures and criteria will be needed.  </p>
<p><strong>KBC Management Metrics: Traceable Outcomes, Goals and Objectives</strong> </p>
<p>Operations and processes of Kansas Business Center can be defined, designed and deployed such that the right data is created for measuring success. System performance metrics tied to goals and objective can be linked to measurable outcomes for stakeholders. The outcomes for businesses and the economy can in turn provide a traceable link to realization of the big picture purposes and vision intended for the KBC. Management of the operations of Kansas Business Center can be anchored upon and evaluated against a regularized system-wide set of such performance metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Example Goal: Promote New Business Formation</strong></p>
<p>Let's say that the driving goal for the KBC ultimately agreed by all parties concerned were the promotion of increasing the number of new businesses created in Kansas. The measures of achievement for this goal could be accomplished directly in a fairly superficial way by simply coding an annual report of the total number of business entities created and observing whether the number was increasing or not. However, the lower level objectives that comprise a high level goal will have their own particular measures based on what typs of data are available and relevant. It would be necessary to break thegeneral goal of new business formation into smaller clusters of objectives and tasks in part to develop better tuned and more actionable business intelligence. </p>
<h3>Narrative Policy Objectives</h3><p>Ideally, to ensure measurable performance and progress toward intended outcomes, each objective should be clearly construed by KBC system providers not only to align project planning, budget allocation and communications strategy but also to specify, scope, standardize and share the actual data needed for analytics and predictive modeling that can determine success at meeting the objective.  </p>
<p>Typically, however, goals and objectives are stated in narrative prose that effectively relays a general state of affairs but frequently does not objectively translate to clear metrics and objective expressions of criteria indicating whether or when the objectie has been achieved. The ambiguity can be useful to some extent, in order to permit or even invite creative interpretations and approached rather than prejudge how the challenge will best be addressed. However this method of describing goals, objectives and tasks can itself be refined in order to better reach the profound potential available from big data driven networked systems such as that proposed for the next version of the KBC.</p>
<p>Simplistically, imagine a senior elected official promised progress on jobs partly with a pithy political phrase like: "Promote, Protect, Prepare and Propel New Business in Kansas".  </p>
<p>For instance, the item "prepare" could be measured by how quickly and completely profile information of a given KBC business account is updated with relevant and important dashboard visualizations, alerts or even to some extent by enabling prospective business parters to discover relevant background information about a business in order to prepare for a sales call, plan to better compete in the open market or perform due diligence in anticipation of a possible partnership. Similarly, the item calling for state government to help "propel" Kansas business could be measured by how many KBC businesses experienced an increase in revenue, or expanded work force.</p>
<p><strong>Data-Driven Measurable Objectives</strong></p>
<p>Consider the potential for data-driven design when a key objective is articulated like this: "Reduce Complexity, Time and Cost of New Business Formation". The measure of this example objective isultimately about the reduction of "frictions" or "impediments" slowing down formation of new business and it is stated in a form that anticipates the kinds of data-sets, types of data services and particular data sources needed to compute achievement of the objective.  </p>
<p>The criteria used for this example objective would relate to comparative analysis between a new KBC system and a prior KBC system or perhaps a comparison with a system of one or more other states in order to benchmark the extent to which the KBC system reduced factors identified as holding back new business formation. </p>
<p>The data acquired should be sufficiently relevant and regularized and refined to establish one way or the other if the KBC produced each of the identified intended results. Reduction of complexity negatively impacting users could potentially be measured by direct data such as calculating the respective number options displayed on the user interface by each system respectively, or the respective number of steps in a process needed to complete an action or the respective number of sessions abandoned prior to completion of an active task. Reduction of time needed to form a new business could be measured by the respective total active session times needed to complete the initial business formation alone and augmented to show views of the total elapsed time in days/hours/minutes from the initiation of the new business formation task until the task completion, including inactive session time during which the user had saved a partially completed form or paused an open process to be continued at later times. Similarly, the amount of time reduction could be measured based upon the time a user completes all required state government interactions in order to open the business to the public, potentially including tax, licensing, permits and other approvals, notices or disclosures. To the extent the related agency processes could be consolidated, accelerated or otherwise facilitated by the KBC system, reductions in time needed to form a new business could be demonstrated. Reduction of costs could also be measured in a number of direct and indirect ways based on data available from or to the KBC.</p>
<p>One can easily see how once some consensus around clear goals and objectives related to agreed basis vision and purposes for the KBC are established, it is possible to greatly increase the adaptive power of a web 2.0 data driven systems design by describing the requisite goals, objectives and outcomes in data and service friendly ways. In this way, it is possible to view the vision and outcomes on a kind of map and to use relevant data-sets, apps and services as sensors, propulsion and navigation of the KBC system toward it's intended destination. While most of the factors and information sources related to goals and objectives for public sector systems are not available easily or at all in an appropriate data-driven mode or accessibly by service oriented networked methods, nonetheless the business community is generally far ahead of state governments. In particular, if KBC were to re-establish itself as a data-intensive and web 2.0 service friendly system then the expression of goals and objectives as computable values will be both possible and highly advisable for those contexts where the intended outcomes are easily and naturally available already.</p>
<p>Not long after a KBC system is established as data-driven components in a dynamic networked environment, the people and processes comprising governance and management of the KBC will becomes more familiar with, competent at and fluet about the operation, maintenance and iterative evolution of these types of systems. In fact, the operation of a REST based service for OAuth2 capable apps and services is not rocket science. This is a design pattern successfully fueling a vast number of apps and services owned, operated and updated daily by teenagers, people starting web 2.0 businesses during nights and weekends and innumerable garage and living room ventures. The overlay of production grade and government adapted processes and procedures can and should be less complicated than the manner of overlay of the same methods with past operational environments.</p>
<p>Once there is a minimum competency with the flows and functions of the type of data-driven architecture being proposed for KBC, it will be increasingly possible not only to formulate ever more goals and objectives as computationally expressible algorithms and analytics but also to start to describe higher level Purposes and Vision as well. The postulated goal "Reduce Complexity, Time and Cost of New Business Formation" was discussed as an example demonstrating how data-driven processes can be designed as automated success metrics. Consider the following high level outline demonstrating how the same basic approach can be used as part of a more comprehensive set of goals that are each themselves tied to higher level vision and outcomes as well as mutually supportive of other related goals:</p>
<p>Vision: Support and Enhance the Business Environment of Kansas With Kansas Business Center</p>
<p>Outcome: Utilize Funding and Authority of INK Statute to Innovate Kansas Business Center </p>
<p>Outcome: Utilize Redesigned KBC to Promote a Vibrant Innovation Economy for Kansas</p>
<p>Goal 1: Promote New Business Formation</p>
<p>Objective 1.A Reduce Complexity, Time and Cost of New Business Formation</p>
<p>Objective 1.B Increase Access to Resources for New Business Formation </p>
<p>Objective 1.C Reward Data, Apps and Services Using KBC to Promote New Business Formation</p>
<p>Goal 2. Enhance Value of Ongoing Business Interactions With State Government </p>
<p>Objective 2.A Align INK and KBC Incentives and Success Metrics With Vision and Goals</p>
<p>Objective 2.B Reduce Duplicative, Manual and Optional Administrative Interaction</p>
<p>Objective 2.C Amplify Business Capabilities and Intelligence With Real-Time Open Data </p>
<p>Goal 3. Catalyze Expansion, Innovation &amp; Capital Formation for Kansas Businesses </p>
<p>Objective 3.A Enable Strategic Use of Information Technology By and For Business</p>
<p>Objective 3.B Amplify Value of State Business Data to Promote Innovation and Expansion</p>
<p>Objective 3.C Leverage Public/Private Partnership to Catalyze Capital Investment</p>
<p>The same approach used with business goals and objectives with data-driven metrics postulated above can also be applied to the legal and technical aspects of the Kansas Business Center. To ensure the legal and technical aspects properly support and reflect the business requirements and constraints that decision makers will expect of a redesigned KBC, corresponding goals, objectives and supporting relevant data-sets and criteria are needed to define success metrics for the electronic and automated legal agreements and system rules as well as for the technical standards, available system functionality and developer resources needed to achieve the overall vision and outcomes desired. By aligning, harmonizing and integrating the business, legal and technical goals, objectives and literal rules and online processes the future redesigned Kansas Business Center can be a fully data-driven, completely networked and widely distributed, massively scalable and profoundly interoperable model of next generation online government.</p>
<h2>Limits and Impediments</h2><p>While the vision of a fully digital business center is compelling, the evolution to a comprehensively web 2.0 public enterprise must be a process rather than an event. Cultural change, testing, piloting, migration, stabilization, maintenance, sustainability, iteration and resilience to surprising events requires a period of time measured in years, not months. Change management to accomplish responsible staging and phasing of deep innovation while ensuring business and user operational continuity of service is challenging. Furthermore, the rest of the state of Kansas and the world will take time to change as well, but the Kansas Business Center must support users and partners with a wide range of technical prowess.</p>
<p>In the context of data-driven success metrics, consider that not all outcomes ara capable of assessment solely from the data generated by or available through the KBC or any single system. Relevant data andother measurable information both from the KBC system itself and also from other relevant sources will be needed in some instances in order to evaluate whether a goal or objective has been achieved. Certain external systems would provide ready sources of relevant data in the same manner as the KBC system precisely through the REST based interfaces employed to interoperate with the KBC via Web 2.0 approach proposed. For instance, activity with integrated apps and services can and should have Flow Event IDs associated with all key interactions - especially those involving user permissions or core business transactions. Most data within or at in/out touch points between the KBC and external systems would not require Flow Event IDs because regular logging and deep detailed reporting would be sufficient to maintain a record if future review is needed but no real time actions or visibility are important.</p>
<p>In most cases, the majority of activity in external systems will be inaccessible to parties governing or managing the KBC and business relationships or contracts will be needed to ensure some level of reporting or notification of key information according over some period of time. Example could include anything from survey data on how system account holder incorporate their KBC data into other parts of business to backend transactional or performance data by third party app and service providers allowed to offer an interface to the KBC transactions. The current state of reporting by external parties is typically not provided as an online automated service in a data-driven manner allowing real-time business, legal and technical processes or automation. While there are significant advantaged to seeking a fully web 2.0 footing for the KBC it is important to note that much key data and business intelligence will source from external system of varying quality, in varying types and by varying methods. Even more importantly, the individual users of the Kansas Business Center have a wide range of technical and legal starting points and will require time, information, training, education and cycles of time to become familiar with this approach.</p>
<h1><strong>PART VII: Kansas Business Center 3.0</strong> <strong>Concept</strong></h1><h1>Vision and Value</h1><p>The Kansas Business Center can enable an efficient and effective relationship between business and government that materially advances the aims of business for a thriving economic environment and aims of government to achieve efficient and effective public administration in the interest of all Kansans. The innovation that can enable breakthrough results for Kansas Business Center has already occurred in the broader environment loosely called “web 2.0” and need only be adopted by and adapted for use.</p>
<p>There is much value and potential to be had from the innovation emerging today, as can be seen in the brief summary above. The strategic task for INK now is to learn about, discuss and decide which approaches can best serve to achieve the purposes, goals and objectives intended by the INK enabling legislation and specifically through the vehicle of redesign for the Kansas Business Center.</p>
<p>As a result of the research and investigation conducted to create this report, the following top items have been identified as an achievable yet high value synthesis of available innovation and capabilities. The following three key architectural underpinnings can unlock the method and mechanism to achieve the full potential of the Kansas Business Center:</p>
<h2>1. Identity Driven Personalization and Convenience</h2><p>a) Automatic Account Creation and Re-Use from Existing User Identity Credentials</p>
<p>This capability allows a user to create a new KBC account by granting authorization to populate the relevant fields with relevant data from their existing accounts with services such as a Google Business Apps account.The same design pattern enables KBC users to authorize access to identity attributes such as their name, email address, physical address and other identifiers or attributes. This can be used to greatly simplify, speed up and improve accuracy for the form filling aspects of business reporting and filings with government agencies accomplished through Kansas Business Center.</p>
<p>b) Binding Many Identifiers and Logins to KBC Account </p>
<p>This capability allows a user to bind externally provision identity credentials and tokens from services such as Google, Yahoo or LinkedIn to their KBC account in order to login and also provides a way to collect and manage additional identifiers such as license, permit or registration numbers.  These attributes, like the other identity-related attributes mentioned above, can also be shared via automatic processes to facilitate the access to and use of key sets of business identifiers across a myriad of state agency transactions.</p>
<p><strong>Future-State:</strong> From User Identity Federation to Business Identity Services. </p>
<p>In the future, this capability can serve as the basis for providing a wide array of business identity services including anti-phishing services allowing other entities and consumers to confirm a given web site is in fact that of a given business and also to assist businesses to prove their identity or to authorize access to authoritative identification or authorizations by state agencies to conduct activities.  </p>
<h2>2. Data Driven Management and Operations </h2><p>a) Protected Data Authorization Services</p>
<p>This capability allows an agency to request and a user to grant authorization to access protected data to, for example, auto-populate a form.</p>
<p>b) Big Data Access Services</p>
<p>This capability allows access to aggregate data sets by Kansas agencies with oversight, evaluation or enforcement responsibilities and also enables “open data” access by members of the public, researchers, economic analysts and others seeking to work with aggregate business center public data.</p>
<p><strong>Future-State:</strong> From Data-Driven Services to Predictive and Analytics Services.</p>
<p>Advanced analytics for big data business intelligence and predictive modeling can be the largest source of value and revenue for a future Kansas Business Center if this proposed design pattern is adopted. The “derived data” used for this type of analysis is at least once removed from personally identifiable data and direct individual data and hence can be anonymzed, aggregated to shared with third parties based upon end-user permissions or revenue sharing models. Business intelligence based on data is key to the future of the economy and of business in the digital age.</p>
<h2></h2><h2>3. Rules Driven Governance and Adaptation</h2><p>a) Standard Interfaces and Data Structures for Easy Upgrade or Replacement</p>
<p>This capability refers to the use of REST and other interfaces and the JSON or other corresponding data structures that are defined and made available by Kansas Business Center as a service provider. This is a foundation of an architecture for rules-driven and performance metric based all-digital public enterprises of the future.</p>
<p>b) Standard system rules and agreements for all users, agencies and third parties</p>
<p>The business, legal and technical integrated systems rules and trust frameworks ensure all parties, systems and interactions occur under predictable legal and policy structures.  </p>
<p><strong>Future-State:</strong> From OAuth Scopes and Rules to Real-Time Service Optimization and Pricing </p>
<p>Ensuring data-driven transactions comply with governance and management rules is essential to the integrity and success of a web 2.0 enterprise – especially in the public sector. The nature of the technologies and design patterns proposed is inherently founded upon permissions, authorizations and explicit rules governing and enforcing access and transaction flow decisions. The audit and oversight information sources to ensure performance and compliance is therefore also a unique capability of these cross-platform web 2.0 approaches.</p>
<h1>Core Value Propositions and Corresponding Capabilities</h1><h2>Business Value Proposition: </h2><p>Easily have any member of business manage KBC account.</p>
<p>Authorize access to key business partners, such as accounting, legal or compliance professionals working with the business. </p>
<p>Access a range of business apps and services integrated with KBC account.</p>
<p>Easily create business webpage and related services, if needed (see Google offering)</p>
<p>Ease administrative aspect of regulatory compliance and filing burdens by multi-state approach and use of common standards. </p>
<h2>Agency Value Proposition </h2><p>Easily provision new or updated forms and other services through the KBC platform.</p>
<p>Increase accuracy and speed of updates for information like change of address.</p>
<p>Reduce cost of managing username/password management and support for users.</p>
<p>Leverage additional apps/services that use the open standards supported by KBC.</p>
<h2>Public Value Proposition </h2><p>Better analysis by media, researchers and public interests groups based upon data.</p>
<p>Direct access to more information about businesses individually and in aggregate.</p>
<h2>Partner Value Proposition </h2><p>Faster, less expensive and more comprehensive access to existing bulk data sources.</p>
<p>Access to new sources of value-added or other premium data sets at competitive rates.</p>
<p>More free information accessible for use and integration with other data sources.</p>
<h1>Core Functional Capabilities and Achievement Metrics</h1><p>The following high level capabilities and success metrics represent a synthesis of the recommended approach and components:</p>
<p>Identity as a Service for Login/Account Identifier Management</p>
<p>Metric: Accept externally issued credentials and tokens to access KBC Account</p>
<p>User Managed Profile for Account/Directory Data Update</p>
<p>Metric: User Updated Address Modifies Account and Updates Subscribed Endpoints</p>
<p>User Granted Authorizations for Personal/Protected Data Sharing</p>
<p>Metric: Protected Resource Access Token Issued According to Scope and Grant</p>
<p>Partner Provisioned Apps/Services for Extended Functional Capabilities</p>
<p>Metric: Manual or Dynamic Registration of OAuth2 Client to KBC Platform </p>
<p>KBC Provisioned Access for Big/Open Data Analytics</p>
<p>Metric: Data-Set Catalog and REST API for Active Query/Subscribe or Bulk Download</p>
<h2>User Account Systems </h2><p>This component provides user accounts and identity federation services.</p>
<p><strong>User Authorized Forms Filling or Other User Granted Permission</strong></p>
<p>The protected resources comprising a user’s account data, such as address, name, email, telephone and other information, can be re-used to seed the automatic pre-fill of forms. In addition, the same capability enables use-granted authorization to access other protected resources, potentially including copies of previous filings, registrations or account history for use by a tax preparer or regulatory compliance professional.</p>
<p><strong>Extensible Login With User’s Native Identity Credentials</strong></p>
<p>Login with LinkedIn, Google Business Apps etc. Essentially the same technology enables login with larger company Active Directory tickets or Kerberos tickets.</p>
<p><strong>Admin Dashboard, Account History and Permissions Management</strong></p>
<p>User managed settings and transactional information. </p>
<h2>Apps and Services Adaptors and Bus</h2><p>Simple OAuth2 manual and dynamic client registration platform capability. Authorization, Access and Resource server functions (see Mule,</p>
<p><strong>Agency Applications</strong> </p>
<p>This component is comprised of the filing, forms, licensing and other transactions between businesses and state agencies. The agency applications are not part of the shared service layer of the Kansas Business Center re-design concept, but are intended to be different and tailored to each interaction type, agency, program or transaction as appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Initial Agency Applications</strong> </p>
<p>The initial applications proposed for development in the scope of this project will enable a user to start a new business with the Secretary of State’s office. In addition, as part of the process of starting a new business, an application with the Kansas Department of Revenue is proposed that will – at a minimum – complete the business tax license application functions available in the current Kansas Business Center. Finally, it will allow businesses to manage their annual report and make amendments to filings with the Secretary of State’s office.</p>
<p>**External Apps and Services:**This component provides integration with external third party applications and services such as available through the Apple or Android Mobile Apps marketplaces, or the constellations of desktop and browser business apps available through Google Business Apps and Salesforce marketplaces. The MIT MODIS open architecture approach, leveraging federated user grants of authorization with the same OAuth2 technical developer and business process integration path commonlyused by business app markets enables major amplification of value. The value to Individual User Account holders is clear, based upon ease of use and leveraging the tools and services they already rely upon. In addition, there are many opportunities for value to agencies and administrators as well.</p>
<h1><strong>PART VIII:</strong> <strong>Next Steps and</strong> **Recommendations </h1><h2>Next Steps:</h2><p>It is proposed that the INK Board use this Report’s research finding and proposed conceptual design approach as an input to deliberation and decision on next steps for the Kansas Business Center.  This Report should also be used to garner feedback from key stakeholders to validate or revise the assumptions and recommendations. Active engagement with and testing of the recommended technologies and solutions identified in this draft is recommended.  </p>
<p>Review and feedback by the INK Board regarding the vision, goals and objectives for KBC is essential to confirm or establish a shared view. In addition, Kansas agencies and counties as well as other local, state or federal agencies may have valuable comments and, selectively, their feedback should be solicited.</p>
<p>Specifically, it is recommended that the INK Board:</p>
<ol><li>Consider the content of the Report and share question, comments or ideas an input to organize a Board Meeting agenda item on this topic;</li></ol>
<ol><li>Host a stakeholder facilitated workshop to stimulate dialog and feedback on the desired direction for Kansas Business Center;</li></ol>
<p>The Attachment “About this Report” includes an excerpt from the INK Board meeting minutes stating that one of the purposes of this effort is to “engage industry leaders to discuss best practices and assist the Board in developing its vision for the future of INK.” While the primary focus of the recommendations in this section is the Kansas Business Center, they also address how the Information Network of Kansas Board might take advantage of opportunities for innovation that support their mission, while also attracting entrepreneurial interest in their work that could also benefit the Kansas Business Center and its ultimate goal of improving the business climate in the state.</p>
<h2>Recommendations</h2><p>This section incorporates suggestions made earlier in the report, as well as those created as an outcome of the analysis. The recommendations are organized into three main areas as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Improvements to the existing Kansas Business Center</strong></li></ul>
<p>The current KBC is operational. Regardless of the approach chosen for going forward, opportunities are available to improve the site with minimal time and effort.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Planning and Implementation for an Improved Kansas Business Center “3.0”</strong></li></ul>
<p>These are the bulk of the recommendations, incorporating the opportunities for innovation previously identified and a set of actions to jump start the process to govern, plan, implement and maintain an improved Kansas Business Center.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Information Network of Kansas Support for Innovation and Entrepreneurship</strong></li></ul>
<p>The innovative public-private partnership first introduced in Kansas was intended to provide flexibility in investments and approach to delivering government services and information. These recommendations offer new ways to take advantage of current national trends in innovation that can also feed economic development efforts and attract entrepreneurship around the Kansas Business Center and related initiatives.</p>
<p>Each area proposes a set of actions that could be taken immediately to advance the effort, as well as a roadmap for the mid- to long-term. </p>
<h2>A. Improvements to the Existing Kansas Business Center</h2><p>The first set of recommendations targets short-term improvements related to the current iteration of the Kansas Business Center. However, their main objective is to lay the foundation for the Kansas Business Center 3.0 project while increasing the usability of the existing site and services.</p>
<h3>Unified Governance and Sponsorship</h3><p>At present, while there is strong interest in improving the business climate in Kansas and in removing obstacles to business formation in the state, lack of clarity on the ownership, executive sponsorship, and distribution of roles and responsibilities around the existing Kansas Business Center makes progress difficult. A central point of coordination for defining goals and success measures,marshalingresources, and advocating for the joint delivery of services to customers is currently lacking. The INK Board should advocate for and participate in new Kansas Business Center governance as part of a revised Board vision that focuses on the economic development value of government information (see recommendations_Information Network of Kansas Support for Innovation and Entrepreneurship_).</p>
<p>**Recommendation 1</p>
<p>**Establish High-Level KBC Governance and Sponsorship</p>
<p>The Information Network of Kansas Board should advocate with the Secretary of State and Governor to establish governance for the existing Kansas Business Center. Thegroup would initially be charged with setting a vision and goals for the Kansas Business Center 3.0 while identifying and implementing short-term improvements in the existing site.</p>
<p>The governance should be composed primarily of business stakeholders (to be expanded or revised over time as the Vision requires) such as the following:</p>
<ul><li>Secretary of State</li><li>Governor’s Office</li><li>Two representatives from the business community</li><li>Network Kansas</li><li>Department of Commerce</li><li>Department of Revenue</li><li>Department of Labor</li><li>Department of Administration</li><li>Information Network of Kansas</li></ul>
<p>The committee should seek advice from existing groups (members of the business community, associations, or internal subject matter experts) along with the Governor’s Council of Economic Advisors. Technical resources (CITO, agency CIOs, vendors) should be consulted where appropriate, with additional advisory groups established only where necessary to avoid depleting momentum.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Analytic Base for Decisions</h3><p>Several key areas of information that would be useful in the identification of existing issues and options for their resolution related to the current Kansas Business Center, as well as in planning and goal setting for the Kansas Business Center 3.0, appear to be missing. While the ability to translate this information into action is predicated on the establishment of formalized governance (see preceding recommendation), the following data points provide sample metrics that could be useful,accompanied by examples of how they might be used:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Enhanced web traffic and site usage profiles.</strong>  </li></ul>
<p>Inbound link profile (what sites are linking in to the KBC; what the traffic interaction is, if any, between KBC and Network Kansas websites); Search terms being used to bring users to the site and by users on the site; Page abandonment (where users stop or leave the site) as well as shopping cart and related payment engine abandonment. This information can be used to perform Search Engine Optimization (SEO) activities as well as improve the usability of the existing site and assist in planning for future efforts.</p>
<ul><li><strong>KBC Registered user profiles.</strong> </li></ul>
<p>Statistics on current KBC registered users in terms of activity (length of subscription (new this period vs. repeat), frequency of use, transaction profile); Number of Kansas.gov subscribers vs. total number of KBC users, the types and volumes of transactions (eg new corp, tax license, batch data, etc) that occur annuallyand similar statistics as well as trends. This information can be used to better understand user community and their behavior andlevel of use of current KBC as a baseline for improvement and incorporated in planning – and perhaps outreach – for a new Kansas Business Center.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Business</strong> <strong>Formation,</strong> <strong>Registration/Licensing</strong> <strong>statistics.</strong>  </li></ul>
<p>Integrated view of the relationship in levels of licensing activities at the two agencies that the KBC is a “feeder” for to understand what percent of licensing is driven by the KBC and associated trends, existing state and trends in electronic v. paper filing and related statistics. Example use is to better understand current effectiveness, role, impact re: the Kansas Business Center as it relates to business formation transactions executed.</p>
<ul><li>**Financial Metrics associated with the Current KBC</li></ul>
<p>What are the annual operating and other costs associated with the Kansas Business Center? What are the annual and net revenues derived by or through of the Kansas Business Center. In attempting to determine the ROI of any further investments, as well as similar functionality to be included in a reboot of the Kansas Business Center, an understanding of the financial model supporting this set of applications is critical.</p>
<p>Recommendation 2</p>
<p><strong>Establish</strong> **Data-Driven Foundation for Assessing KBC Performance </p>
<p>As part of advocacy for independent governance for the Kansas Business Center, the Information Network of Kansas Board should recommend and dedicate resources to supporting enhanced data analysis related to KBC traffic and transactions in line with the examples outlined above. </p>
<h3>Usability Improvements</h3><p>As documented earlier in this report, a cursory review of the existing Kansas Business Center interface suggests that there are opportunities for improvement. Such improvements are likely to come at a relatively low cost, and should establish a usability baseline against which to judge improvements (see recommendation for “data-driven foundation” above) and also produce data from new and existing customers that can be incorporated in the vision for the future Kansas Business Center.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> <strong>3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Perform user-testing on the existing Kansas Business Center website, along with related agency applications.</strong></p>
<p>The Information Network of Kansas Board of Directors should invest in independent user testing of the existing Kansas Business Center and those applications that are currently integrated with it, with the intent of identifying “quick hit” improvements and collecting data that can be used to inform planning for the future KBC.</p>
<h3></h3><h3>Integrated Planning and Coordination</h3><p>In general, recommending a focus on short-term improvements to the existing KBC comes from an acknowledgement that the current site and related agency applications are currently in use and that a project to replace them cannot be completed overnight. On a similar note, it also seems likely_that new initiatives targeted at business customers are poised in either the planning stages or are in some stage of development_. Visibility into the current state of those projects will be required for, the new Kansas Business Center governance committee to accurately assess the appropriate role and level of short-term investment in the current KBC as it relates to these initiatives, as well as offer guidance and coordination on timing and approach for their participation of sponsoring agencies in the new Kansas Business Center.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> <strong>4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Create an inventory of current state business-facing initiatives with an online component that are presently in the planning or implementation stages.</strong></p>
<p>The inventory and associated discussions with agency executives would be used by the KBC steering committee in establishing a unified vision and roadmap for Kansas Business Center 3.0, as well as making timing and staging decisions to set common expectations and ensure a coordinated implementation of the vision.</p>
<p>Finally, the initial revisiting of the existing Kansas Business Center can provide vital information about the appropriate scope and approach for reinvention efforts. The final recommendation in this section seeks to obtain advice from where it matters most:</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> <strong>5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Incorporate the Voice of the Customer in Shaping the Vision</strong> </p>
<p>As part of implementing the recommendations above, reach out to the business community to identify roadblocks to business registration and filing, as well as opportunities for closer integration that can be incorporated in the scope of the KBC 3.0 project. Most efforts in other states point to this step as an early key to success. </p>
<h2>B. Kansas Business Center 3.0 Planning and Implementation</h2><p>The second set of recommendations relate to the next steps required to plan and execute a successful reinvention of the Kansas Business Center, hereafter referred to as the “Kansas Business Center 3.0” project. The “3.0” designation has a dual purpose – the first is to pay homage to the 2003 and 2008 versions that came before it. The second expresses an intent to leverage the innovative practices currently emerging nationally that superseded the Web 2.0/Gov 2.0 trends of the last decade by making use of RESTful web services, mashups, geomapping, federated identity, mobile first design, and other consumer technologies to extend to combine and extend government processes to interoperate seamlessly with the tasks and technologies used by citizens and businesses every day to accomplish their work.</p>
<p>These recommendations build upon the recommendations made in the previous section, as well as concepts from both the <em>Key Use Cases and Requirements</em>, and <em>Identification and Evaluation of Alternatives</em> sections to propose a roadmap for Kansas Business Center 3.0 implementation.</p>
<h3>Planning and Governance</h3><p>The next steps assume that the State has agreed to establish a KBC steering committee. If so, they should immediately proceed to implement Recommendation 2 &amp; 3 above. However, if the Steering Committee decides to move forward in preparation for a Kansas Business Center 3.0 project, the following planning and governance tasks should be performed.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> <strong>1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hire a project director</strong> <strong>to lead</strong> <strong>the Kansas Business Center 3.0 project.</strong>  </p>
<p>The INK Board should fund this position as an employee of INK, but have it report to the steering committee for the duration of the project. This will not only publicly signal and reinforce INK as a significant stakeholder andjoint sponsor of the project, but also create a bridge to integration of the new KBC technologies and processes into other INK applications.</p>
<p>Once the steering committee and Board have taken this step, the implementation of the inventory outlined in <em>Recommendation 4</em> above should be built out to a create a more comprehensive picture of the “as-is” situation with business filing in the state.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Establish an E-Business Inventory</strong>. </p>
<p>Fund the creation of an inventory of primary systems involved in business licensing across cabinet agencies with the idea of identifying “low hanging fruit” – processes and technical capabilities where incentives exist for “quick hits” in removing roadblocks and increasing access and usability. <strong>As discussed previously, automation of bulk filing should be a priority, as for many intermediaries, a website could be much less useful than creating the ability to file in bulk electronically.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> <strong>3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Baseline selected key business registration and licensing transactions at the state.</strong></p>
<p>To understand the cost-benefit and return-on-investment of process reengineering, as well as to factor in current levels of inconvenience and cost to businesses to prioritize functions for inclusion in the scope of a Kansas Business Center 3.0, it is necessary to establish “as-is” benchmarks for these processes. How long does it take on average to form a business? Without measuring some aspects of the current environment, it will be difficult to ensure that the “real” problems are addressed, and to provide justification for the investment in significant changes.</p>
<p>Once executive leadership has a better view of both the opinions and experiences of current customers and the state of the most oft-used processes and systems for registration and licensing, the Steering Committee should weigh carefully the value of reengineering processes and streamlining of associated regulations to avoid “paving the cow path” by automating processes without revisiting their efficiency. In this vein, the following recommendation should be considered optional based on policy, timing, the feedback of businesses, and other drivers in the current economic environment.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> <strong>4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Convene a “Blue Ribbon Panel” on Streamlining Business Regulation</strong></p>
<p>Considering the oft-cited complexity and opaque nature of some of these processes, it seems like it would be profitable to begin efforts to improve the Kansas Business Center by commissioning a review of these processes by some type of “blue-ribbon panel”, a joint group of private and public sector representatives who could offer recommendations for reengineering and streamlining them before further automation is attempted, if only within particular targeted categories. For examples, see the Oregon Regulatory Streamlining and Simplification Initiative at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oregon.gov/COO/Pages/regulatory.aspx">http://www.oregon.gov/COO/Pages/regulatory.aspx</a>, the Washington State Auditor’s 2012 report on Regulatory Reform at</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sao.wa.gov/auditreports/auditreportfiles/ar1008276.pdf">http://www.sao.wa.gov/auditreports/auditreportfiles/ar1008276.pdf</a>, or the State of New Jersey Red Tape Review Commission (<a href="http://www.nj.gov/state/dos_red_tape.html">http://www.nj.gov/state/dos_red_tape.html</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, while sponsorship and priority should be visible to state agencies and the public through the chartering of a steering committee and the accompanying outreach, the last recommendation in this section comes from our interviews with other states.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> <strong>5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pursue Business One-Stop</strong> <strong>Legislation and Executive Order.</strong> </p>
<p>The INK Board should recommend that the Steering Committee advocate the introduction of legislation accompanied by an Executive Order as a clear signal of the desire for cooperation, focus, and responsiveness to business in the form of the Kansas Business Center 3.0 effort. While there is clearly interest in this project at executive levels today, all of the states interviewed took this step to clarify both expectations and sponsorship for the project.</p>
<h3>Project Execution</h3><p>Earlier in the <em>Evaluation_section of this report, the recommendation was to pursue two paths in parallel. The first was to_Deploy a Toolbox for Intergovernmental Business Registration and Filing</em>. If the state is to embark on a KBC 3.0 project, the four elements of that strategy should be pursued from the outset. Proposed approaches for two items from that strategy deserve special mention here:</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> <strong>6</strong></p>
<p><strong>Implement Federated Identity as a Service.</strong> </p>
<p>Approach INK to offer federated identity services for state agency business filers. As noted in the <em>Strategic Context of this Initiative</em> section earlier in this report, the state declared interest in a single sign-on solution for business as early as 2010, but that approach is not yet currently in place.</p>
<p>INK was created for the purpose of “routing around” bureaucracy and the long planning and implementation cycles of traditional government. The Board can easily work with third party providers to create an identity offering that could be used to streamline interactions with business. It is also possible that an existing credential, such as the username and password approach currently used by a popular business partner like the Kansas Department of Revenue or Department of Labor could be extended for this purpose. Whatever the approach, the implementation of federated identity could jumpstart innovation efforts in this and other areas of government service delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> <strong>7</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pursue account management functionality for use in business filing statewide.</strong></p>
<p>It is not clear whether this could be developed as a freestanding service, in concert with federated ID, or as an extension of account management functionality currently in place at INK, or even that planned or used like the Kansas Department of Revenue. However, as explained as part of a previous discussion, this type of functionality is sorely needed,and may be able to be built free-standing, whether or not a project to build some type of comprehensive integrated filing center is undertaken.</p>
<p>Until final decisions have been made on scope and agency participation, it is difficult to provide detailed cost and planning information for a KBC 3.0 project. However, the execution phase of this project should follow the standard methodology for Information Technology projects in use at the State of Kansas. To start, a project charter should be developed that includes a clear and commonly accepted scope. Efforts should be made to develop detailed requirements that incorporate the information outlined in this document. In reviewing materials from other states, the_State of Indiana Business One-Stop_project appears to have many commonalities with the overall scope, if not the identical technical approach, as the State of Kansas, and this was confirmed by our conversation with them. The Information Network of Kansas Board and those sponsors and agencies that will beassociated with this project should review the project planning materials they have developed and make use of these artifacts in crafting an approach to the Kansas Business Center 3.0 project.  See <em>http://www.in.gov/idoa/proc/bids/rfp-14-47/</em> for copies of their recent RFI and associated documents.</p>
<h2>C. Information Network of Kansas Support for Innovation and Entrepreneurship</h2><p>As noted elsewhere in this Report, in its first two decades, the Information Network of Kansas model was a groundbreaking innovation in service funding and delivery. Now, the current INK Board has an opportunity to again “move the needle” on innovation by turning its focus to a number of nascent efforts to open up government data at the local and national level.</p>
<p>By statute, the Information Network of Kansas is charged to (K.S.A 74-9302): </p>
<p><em>“…explore ways and means of expanding the amount and kind of public information provided, increasing the utility of the public information provided and the form in which provided, expanding the base of users who access such public information and, where appropriate, implementing such changes;”</em> </p>
<p>and to</p>
<p><em>“…explore technological ways and means of improving citizen and business access to public information and, where appropriate, implement such technological improvements;”</em></p>
<p>The INK Board is uniquely charged with the responsibility to explore the kinds of innovation in information delivery that are outlined in the Innovation Survey section of this report. The following recommendations call for a renewed vision for INK that places an emphasis on two pieces of INK’s statutory foundation:</p>
<p><strong>_Expanding Access to_</strong> <strong>_Public Information_</strong></p>
<p><strong>and</strong></p>
<p><strong>_Increasing the Utility_</strong> <strong>_of Information Provided_</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Time is Now</strong></p>
<p>This focus on public information aligns very closely with the economic development program of the state. The following excerpt from the Governor’s Strategic Economic Development plan (2011) provides the principle:</p>
<p><em>Focus state resources on important activities that the state can do best: supply the “public goods” parts of the economic development process.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kansas Governor’s Strategic Economic Development Plan</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://governor.ks.gov/economic-development-strategic-plan">http://governor.ks.gov/economic-development-strategic-plan</a></p>
<p>And, when it comes to the value of public information in economic development, <strong>_the Information Network of Kansas can deliver the “goods”_.</strong>  The spirit of INK is not about technology. INK is about innovation, creativity, and flexibility – a public-private partnership exempt from state procurement regulations, with broad representation on its leadership board with the intent of fostering partnerships, experimentation, and innovation beyond the horizons of state bureaucracy.</p>
<p>To move to a national leadership position in innovation, the INK Board should capitalize on the work going on in the field of Open Data and electronic government innovation in service delivery occurring at the local level. These new ideas and energy that can be imported and leveraged to the state level to deliver on the second part of INK’s mission, <em>to increase the utility of the information provided</em> to citizens, businesses, and other interested parties in ways that can serve as a platform for third-party innovation. The following recommendations offer new ways to take advantage of current national trends that can also feed economic development efforts and attract entrepreneurship around the Kansas Business Center and related initiatives.</p>
<h2>Leading Kansas State Government Innovation</h2><p>INK has spent the past two years focused on the “back office”. While a primary source of growth has been the expansion of KanPay Counter applications to schools and local government, as well as on issues around performance, administration of grant funds, and the composition of credit card charges, these initiatives do not position INK as a leader, nor provide the kind of energy and leadership – the “spirit of INK” – that has won the board national recognition in the past. While increasing the utility of information may manifest itself in a move to “mobile first”, to the degreethat this is simply reconfiguring or reinventing the delivery of previous services, these efforts appear – from the outside at least – to lack the spark of innovation evidenced in the kinds of projects and organizations outlined in the Innovation Survey section of this Report.</p>
<h3>Plan and Organize to Lead</h3><p>The INK Board and Executive Director must begin planning and organizing to lead.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> <strong>1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Partner with</strong> <strong>National</strong> <strong>Leaders in Government</strong> <strong>3.0</strong> <strong>Innovation</strong> <strong>to Contribute to Current INK Strategic and Business Planning Efforts - Including Identification of New Initiatives and Partnership Opportunities.</strong></p>
<p>Contacting and attracting the participation of these leaders and leading organizations is not intended simply to put words to paper, but to have vigorous discussions to frame the business of INK in new ways, to discover new opportunities, and develop new partnerships that can create an “innovation engine” at INK for the long-term.</p>
<p>Examples of leaders and organizations include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul><li>Code for America (Jen Pahlka, on leave as U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officer)</li><li>New Urban Mechanics (Nigel Jacob, Co-founder, New Urban Mechanics)</li><li>Kauffman Labs (Bo Fishback, Vice President for Entrepreneurship)</li><li>Google (Ginny Hunt, Principal, Strategy and Civic Innovation)</li><li>MIT (Dr. Sandy Pentland, MIT Media Lab Entrepreneurship and Innovations)</li><li>Governance Lab (Beth Noveck, cofounder; Joel Gurin, advisor)</li><li>Open Data Institute (Gavin Starks, Chief Executive Officer)</li><li>Data.gov (Jeanne Holm, Data.gov Evangelist at GSA)</li><li>Open Knowledge Foundation (Jonathan Gray, Director of Policy and Ideas)</li><li>Center for Technology in Government (Theresa Pardo, Director)</li></ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> <strong>2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Form a standing</strong> <strong>Innovation Committee of the Board devoted to</strong> <strong>continuous exploration of</strong> <strong>opportunities for public and private partnerships for innovative delivery and use of government **information.</strong></p>
<p>The Board must maintain a constant focus on bringing in innovative ideas and opportunities for partnership and investment for evaluation and to raise the awareness of the Board members on industry and government trends in data sharing and service delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Outside-In Approach to Government Innovation</strong></p>
<p>The Information Network of Kansas Board should take an “Outside-In” approach to innovation and focus on incentivizing external parties and entrepreneurs, in the spirit of INK, to bring “in” new ideas to Kansas government to both solve problems and unlock information for reuse and third-party innovation.</p>
<p>While the grant process should be structured to remain flexible to reserve the capacity to invest in late-breaking or unplanned projects, the Board should immediately move to reorient the focus of their investments as outlined in the following recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> <strong>3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Take a leadership and ownership role in creating and hosting a</strong> <strong>_data.kansas.gov_</strong> <strong>website to host Open Data sets, making available state assets to seed economic development, accountability and transparency efforts.</strong> </p>
<p>For data.kansas.gov efforts to achieve optimum value, the Information Network of Kansas should invest in stimulating discussion and innovation around Open Data. The following recommendations align with this goal and have the added benefit of attracting interest and opportunities for collaboration to discussions about increasing innovation in the INK model. The INK Executive Director should be charged with pursuing these initiatives at the direction of the INK Innovation Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> <strong>4</strong></p>
<p><strong>The INK Board should take a primary leadership role in fostering conversations about the value of Open Data and information generally in economic development, transparency, and government efficiency in the State of Kansas. The initial efforts should be coordinated by the Innovation Committee and focus on three approaches:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Data and Democracy Symposium and Lecture Series.</strong> Sponsor and convene a symposium on Data, Development, and Democracy that brings together thought leaders in e-Government, e-Democracy, and Open Data with business, political leaders, and entrepreneurs to explore ways in which government information can serve as a platform to remove government obstacles to innovation, spur economic development, and increase civic engagement in the political process, along with improving government efficiency and policy outcomes.</li><li><strong>Open Data Business Plan competition.</strong> Sponsor, in collaboration with Network Kansas, Kauffman Labs, and other Kansas institutions focused on economic development and entrepreneurship, the Information Network of Kansas Open Data Business Plan competition. The competition should have two components. The first incentivizes startups and entrepreneurs to explore sources of government data and potential uses for economic development and civic good. The second focuses on the policy issues around potential uses of government open data (privacy, security, etc). Expertise from big data researchers at MIT Media Lab, NYU’s Governance Lab project, and policy experts from Kansas academic institutions should be involved in shaping the competition to ensure the information gained will be used to advance understanding and dialog on these issues among citizens, business, and government.</li><li><strong>Geospatial Innovation Fellows program.</strong>  As outlined in other sections of this Report, geospatial information technology has tremendous capabilities to expand services available to Kansas citizen and businesses, increase the understanding of both policy gaps and impacts, and spur innovation and economic development. The Information Network of Kansas board should begin a pilot program to sponsor individuals from the private sector, academia, and government to raise awareness of innovative uses of geospatial technology to increase the economic competitiveness of Kansas and the quality of life of Kansas citizens through demonstration projects that leverage Kansas’ position as a national leader in this area. This program can be overseen by both public and private experts and organizations, along with entrepreneurs and civic leaders convened by INK who can identify opportunities to address pressing problems and emerging opportunities in our state.</li></ul>
<h3>Align with and Sponsor Progress on Statutory Initiatives</h3><p>The last set of recommendations expanding innovation involves tighter integration with existing Kansas initiatives. While some ofthese ideas are embodied in other sections, they deserve separate emphasis and focus for the Board. All have received legislative support and provide unique opportunities for innovation and support the mission of INK.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> <strong>5</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Information Network of Kansas Board should convene jointly over a series of meetings with representatives from each community represented by the following innovative Kansas initiatives with the goal of better understanding opportunities for long-term partnership and investment:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Kansas One Map Act</strong></li><li><strong>Kansas Taxpayer Transparency Act</strong></li><li><strong>Kansas Enterprise Electronic Preservation project</strong></li></ul>
<p>At a minimum, the Board should make an ongoing commitment to investment in the <strong>GIS Innovation Fellow</strong> position, the creation and support of ongoing efforts to expand the amount and kind of data delivered on <strong>data.kansas.gov</strong>, and commit to tighter integration of <strong>Open Data efforts</strong> with the Kansas Electronic Enterprise Preservation initiative making the State of Kansas a leader in making Kansas heritage and “long data” sets tracking changes over time in economic development, legislation and regulations, transportation and other types of data available to its citizens to increase transparency, accountability, and to spur innovation.</p>
<ul><li>**Kansas OneMap Act.**The 2012 Kansas OneMap Act (HB 2175) presents an excellent opportunity for investment and full-scale support by the INK Board. While the Act envisions a unified approach to the creation and use of mapping data across the state, it has the potential to revolutionize the capacity of the state to deliver meaningful information that increases the quality of life of citizens and make Kansas more competitive in the national economy. The salient portion of the Act reads as follows:</li></ul>
<p>Sec. 5. The board shall:</p>
<p>(a) Establish public and private partnerships throughout Kansas to maximize value, minimize cost and avoid redundant activities in the development and implementation of geographic information systems;</p>
<p>(b) foster efficient and secure methods for data sharing at all levels of government;</p>
<p>(c) coordinate, review and provide recommendations on geographic information systems programs and investments and provide assistance with dispute resolution among geographic systems partners;</p>
<p>(d) continue to establish Kansas’ leadership role in the national effort to improve capabilities for sharing geographic information and ideas with other states;</p>
<p>(e) promote the use of geographic information systems technologies as tools to break through structural and administrative boundaries to collaborate on shared problems and enhance information analysis and decision-making processes within all levels of government;</p>
<ul><li><strong>Kansas Taxpayer Transparency Act.</strong> This 2008 Act (HB 2368) created a Public Finance Transparency Board (See <a href="http://www.kansas.gov/KanView/hb2368.html">http://www.kansas.gov/KanView/hb2368.html</a>) to oversee a website that displayed public financial data. The website was originally constructed and hosted on INK. The legislation was a first step toward the type of transparency and open data delivery anticipated in INK’s enabling statutes. However, the legislation is slated to expire on June 30, 2014.</li></ul>
<p>This legislation provides a unique opportunity for the INK Board to take a leadership position, in partnership with the Governor’s office and Secretary of Administration in driving the integration and expansion of this function of government. The legislation was sponsored by a longtime supporter of INK, Rep. Jim Morrison, who has previously recognized by the Board for his contributions to and support of the INK Mission.</p>
<p>While the Board has not convened in the last several years, its structure and membership is composed in a way that makes it well-suited to collaboration on INK initiatives:</p>
<p>(1) The secretary of administration or the secretary’s designee, who shall serve as chairperson of the board;(2) the director of accounts and reports or the director’s designee;</p>
<p>(3) two members who are chief executive officers of agencies of the executive branch or such officer’s designees, appointed by the governor, who shall serve at the pleasure of the governor;</p>
<p>(4) four members of the general public, two appointed by the governor, one appointed by the president of the senate and one appointed by the speaker of the house;</p>
<p>(5) four members of the legislature, one appointed by the president of the senate, one appointed by the minority leader of the senate, one appointed by the speaker of the house, and one appointed by the minority leader of the house, all of whom shall serve at the pleasure of the appointing official;</p>
<p>(6) the legislative post auditor or such auditor’s designee;</p>
<p>(7) the state archivist or such archivist’s designee;</p>
<p>Like the OneMap Act, this legislation also provides for advise on new types of data and directs state agencies to cooperate – an approach that supports the INK mission directly – as shown in the following:</p>
<p>After implementation of the initial website, the public finance transparency board shall advise the secretary of administration on incorporating additional information described by this act from any other source of information available to the secretary of administration including information submitted by state agencies pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. (d) Any state agency shall provide, at the request of the secretary of administration, such information as is necessary to accomplish the purposes of this act.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas Enterprise Electronic Preservation.</strong>  (<a href="http://keep.ks.gov/">http://keep.ks.gov/</a>) HB2195 (2011), now K.S.A 45-414, grants the Kansas State Archivist, along with the State Records Board, the authority to establish standards for maintaining the authenticity of government records in Kansas. In a companion project, INK, along with the Library of Congress, funded the creation of a trusted digital repository for Kansas State records of enduring value. As the Information Network of Kansas Board demonstrates leadership through the initiatives outlined above, they should continue to invest in and create stronger partnership with the Kansas State Historical Society and the Kansas Enterprise Electronic Preservation function of state government.</p>
<p>The state archivist’s statutory authority for authenticating electronic records, coupled with the experience information science, metadata, electronic cataloging and service delivery to the public make him and the state archives unique partners for the Information Network of Kansas. However, an investment in a continuing partnership can bring more benefits to INK. As continued fiscal pressure is exerted on state and local government, the KEEP repository provides a ready resource to take over custody of open records that have enduring value to the public. As information and documents move more to standardized data formats, it is the Kansas State Historical Society that will build the large collections of data that the public, business, and researchers will be interested in. For policy development, longitudinal data collected over time can be of great help in understanding and predicting demographic and economic trends. Our state’s history, cast through a geospatial lens, will be invaluable in better preparing for resource allocation challenges, public safety, and researchers in natural resources, transportation, and even health. The Kansas State Historical Society is in the “information business” and should be considered a foundational partner in INK initiatives.</p>

<h2>Scope of this Report</h2><p>This document was prepared by Daniel “Dazza” Greenwood (Architect) as per Statement of Work v1.6, Proposal 3076 as executed June 28, 2013 titled “Creation/Validation of Conceptual Design Alternatives for the Kansas Business Center” and incorporates significant contributions by the INK appointed Points of Contact Duncan Friend and Kathy Sachs of the state of Kansas as a collaborative endeavor.  The initial proposal to conduct this work was proffered on March 25th, 2013 and work on the project contributed by Architect prior to the effective contract date of June 28th, 2013 was provided on a voluntary basis pending confirmation of the formal scope, deliverables and mutual obligations. Contributions by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are independent and outside the scope of this engagement.</p>
<h2>Focus Areas of this Report</h2><p>The primary focus of this report is the Kansas Business Center. However, this work was originally commissioned by the INK Board with the purpose of investigating best practices, technologies and opportunities for reinvention of not just the Kansas Business Center, but the vision and strategy of the Information Network of Kansas itself. This is confirmed by the Board action reflected in their March 2013 meeting minutes authorizing funding to be used to engage “industry leaders to discuss best practices and assist the Board in developing its vision for the future of INK.”</p>
<p>While the principles and technologies outlined in the report are focused primarily on the KBC, they are also directly relevant to a reinvention of the approaches used by the Information Network of Kansas. A summary of the work conducted during the development of this report with various industry experts as it relates to these goals, including discussions with Dr. Alex Pentland of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab and Dr. Beth Noveck, former Deputy Chief Information Technology Officer of the United States and currently founder and principal at New York University’s Wagner School of Public Service Governance Lab, is includedas an Attachment. In addition, a section devoted to recommendations for how the Information Network of Kansas can increase their role in support of entrepreneurship and innovation in the delivery of government information and help fuel greater economic development in the State of Kansas is included in theNext Steps and Recommendations section of this report.</p>
<p>While previous work has been done to develop and improve the existing Kansas Business Center, this report represents a new project to consider options for reinvention of the existing approach that would address fundamental issues encountered in both the current KBC and business one-stop efforts pursued by other states. By necessity, then, the report explores methods for the establishment of identity and the reuse and sharing of information that differ somewhat from the approaches used to-date and investigates emerging trends and technologies that can be used to create new and innovative improvements.</p>
<p>In this light, the report focuses on several objectives that support the goal of improving the Kansas Business Center.  <strong>First</strong>, it provides a high-level review of the history, mission, and strategic planning related to the current KBC along with its functionality and identifies opportunities for improvement/reinvention.  <strong>Second</strong>, it surveys the environment to determine best practices, known issues, and potential technologies and approaches that might be of use in meeting the goals of a new KBC. <strong>Third</strong>, based on the preceding steps, it proposes principles and a decision making framework to be used in identifying and evaluating options. <strong>Fourth</strong>, the report outlines high-level requirements for a new Kansas Business Center that are suitable for use as a starting point in developing a proof-of-concept, as well as for building out a Request for Information to solicit proposals from potential partners. <strong>Fifth</strong>, it considers alternative approaches to meeting those requirements using the framework previously proposed. Finally,**the report concludes with recommendations and an actionable roadmap** for moving forward on this effort.</p>
<h2>Conceptual Design and Detailed Requirements </h2><p>The determination of high-level design patterns, scenarios of use and functionality described in this Report for a re-designed Kansas Business Center were specifically developed from:</p>
<ul><li>Discussions with the management in the Business Services division of the Secretary of State’s office, </li><li>Interviews with principals involved in Business One-Stop efforts in other states,</li><li>A review of the artifacts provided from the 2009-2010 efforts to construct high-level process diagrams around several process related to business formation and licensing,</li><li>A high-level review of the existing Kansas Business Center functionality (_see above_), and </li><li>An extrapolation of the underlying design patterns enabling web 2.0 transactions and data flows as applied in the context of the transactions by and between parties using the Kansas Business Center.</li></ul>
<p>Establishing detailed requirements, constraints and use cases intended to drive the software code development, integration or configuration of specific technologies is beyond the scope of this Report. However, such detailed decision are necessary at the appropriate moment in the process of re-design for the Kansas Business Center and should be preceded by and aligned with the INK Board’s eventual determination of vision, purpose and goals for the Kansas Business Center. The detailed use cases must also reflect and support a process of negotiated consensus building among all the key stakeholders that will depend upon, operate or otherwise significantly impact or be impacted by the system. Chief among these stakeholders are the Kansas businesses that the system is primarily intended to benefit and second the agencies, departments and other organs of government that will interoperate with and through the system. The detailed functionality for Kansas Business Center improvements and specific requirements from other state agencies or local units of Kansas government is not, therefore, intended to be part of this conceptual design. See the Next Stepsand Recommendations section of this report for recommendations on further work to be done in this area. </p>
<p>Creating a firm basis for estimating the time, cost and performance capabilities of vendor provided and other potential sources of solutions is the highest value next step for the KBC project. The final report is intended to articulate an assessment of current state and a recommended direction for the KBC, including reference to potential products and services that could achieve the recommended results. The report can form the conceptual basis supporting a project plan and contractual relationships necessary to achieve the redesign and re-launch of the KBC. The report itself, however, is not intended to include the fine grained detail on implementation requirements or specific price quotations that would result from negotiated agreements or proposals to an RFP from solution providers.</p>

<p><strong>Exploring the Future of the Information Network of Kansas</strong></p>
<p>Although a comprehensive discussion of the meetings and activities related to this work with Dazza and MIT is beyond the scope of this document, a brief explanation is provided as context for its relationship to the work in the <em>Statement of Work</em> contained in the contract discussed below, as well as to emphasize the level of effort and value provided by Dazza and other representatives of MIT’s Human Dynamics area of the Media Lab.  </p>
<p>**MIT Kerberos and Internet Trust Consortium.**In his role at MIT, Dazza facilitated discussion on the Kansas Business Center and future strategic direction of INK, along with various approaches to how a relationship with MIT might be structured. These options included working with (or joining) the MIT Kerberos and Internet Trust Consortium. MIT’s Kerberos Consortium includes representatives like Oracle, Microsoft, NASA and the Department of Defense (DOD) in supporting the source code for Kerberos, “the most widely deployed system for authentication and authorization in modern computer networks.” (<a href="http://www.kerberos.org/index.html">http://www.kerberos.org/index.html</a>). The MIT Kerberos and Internet Trust (KIT) Consortium (<a href="http://kit.mit.edu/">http://kit.mit.edu/</a>) is a relatively new offshoot with a mission to _develop the basic building blocks for the Internet's emerging personal data ecosystem in which people, organizations, and computers can manage access to their data more efficiently and equitably._This organization is of special interest because it recently acquired source code developed by Mitre Corporation, a DOD contractor, that can be used in secure authentication and sharing of data. The KIT also includes community and advisory board members such as Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Stanford University and Fidelity Investments, demonstrating industry interest and commitment by major companies in this space to their efforts. More detail on the Mitre software, and the KIT can be found at:<a href="http://kit.mit.edu/projects/mitreid-connect">http://kit.mit.edu/projects/mitreid-connect</a> and <a href="http://kit.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/MIT_KIT_2013_Background_web.pdf‎">http://kit.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/MIT_KIT_2013_Background_web.pdf‎</a>. Via Dazza’s coordination, our contact and work in this area was with Dr. Thomas Hardjono, Executive Director and Technical Lead for both organizations. We met and presented with him at the Human Dynamics area of the MIT Media Lab as well as participated in interactive video conferencing via Google Hangouts.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Alex “Sandy” Pentland/MIT Media Lab Entrepreneurship and Digital Innovations Seminar</strong></p>
<p>As part of our initial discussions and in support of the charge of the INK subcommittee regarding the RFP, Dazza, in his role as MIT Adjunct Instructor worked with the head of the Human Dynamics Lab, Dr. Alex Pentland, to arrange a presentation soliciting ideas from the above-referenced class about possible next steps on both the Kansas Business Center and the Information Network of Kansas model. Dr. Pentland is a world-renown computer scientist, and director of both the MIT Media Lab’s Human Dynamics Laboratory and the Media Lab Entrepreneurship program (<a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/people/sandy">http://www.media.mit.edu/people/sandy</a>). This is the flagship class for the MIT Media Lab program that has produced a large number of startup companies (see: <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/sponsorship/spin-offs">http://www.media.mit.edu/sponsorship/spin-offs</a> for a list of Media Lab spinoffs) and where students were currently engaged in developing proposals for MIT’s $100K Entrepreneurship Competition <a href="http://www.mit100k.org/general/">http://www.mit100k.org/general/</a>that has produced over 160 companies. We presented live via Google Hangout to the class to solicit their questions and ideas on innovative approaches to both the Information Network of Kansas model and the Next Generation Kansas Business Center. Dazza was instrumental in this effort, spending a large amount of time outside work arranging, developing, and facilitating the presentation. More information on the course can be found at:<a href="http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/15/sp13/15.376/">http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/15/sp13/15.376/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>MIT Media Lab and Human Dynamics Lab Visit and KBC Prototype Discussions</strong></p>
<p>In Dazza’s role as an adjunct professor, he also arranged and hosted a visit for State of Kansas representatives at the MIT Media Lab where we presented questions and concepts around the KBC to Dr. Pentland. We worked with a student to conduct a preliminary evaluation of how his project’s use of federated credentials and a private personal data store to enable participants to protect data for a 4,000 person study at Denmark Technical University might be useful in addressing problems encountered by Kansas entrepreneurs in negotiating the cumbersome process of multiple sign-ons and continuous re-entry of the same basic data across licensing applications silo’d in individual agencies. Dazza dedicated significant time before, during, and after this visit to working on a prototype architecture and straw man demonstration of these concepts, an example of which can be viewed online at: <a href="http://youtu.be/DIyWeH-CGfM">http://youtu.be/DIyWeH-CGfM</a>. </p>
<p>Both Dazza and Dr. Pentland are involved in a group created through a federal effort by the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC) (<a href="http://www.nist.gov/nstic/about-nstic.html">http://www.nist.gov/nstic/about-nstic.html</a>) called the Identity Ecosystem Steering Group (<a href="http://www.idecosystem.org/">http://www.idecosystem.org/</a>), where Dazza is currently vice chair. Access to this set of expertise in considering ways to streamline the current repetitive and cumbersome authentication process for business entity formation and licensing were greatly aided by Dazza’s efforts and involvement.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Beth Noveck, MIT Media Lab, and the NYU Governance Lab</strong></p>
<p>The Information Network of Kansas serves as a groundbreaking model nationally, and, in exploring the potential to reinvent both the INK Model for the RFP and the next generation Kansas Business Center, the SOS contacted Dr. Beth Noveck of New York University. Dr. Noveck is an internationally known scholar and practitioner in Open Data and Institutional Innovation, and served as the first deputy chief technology officer for Open Government for the U.S. Government. Currently, she is a co-founder and director of the Governance Lab at NYU, a project that brings technological innovations to bear in improving citizen participation in government. As a result of this outreach, she invited the Secretary of State, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, Jim Minihan, and a representative of OITS to attend a conference where a special session was developed to focus on soliciting innovative approaches to the Kansas Business Center, featuring a prototype “Business Sensor” mobile application developed by Greg Elin, Knight Foundation award winner and Chief Data Officer for the Federal Communications Commission that was presented to representatives from the MacArthur and Knight Foundations, along with Sir Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the World Wide Web) and a number of open government innovators.</p>
<p><em>Damian Thorman, Program Officer for the MacArthur Foundation, Jim Minihan, Kathy Sachs, and Duncan Friend w/Sir Tim Berners-Lee, Greg Elin (FCC) and Beth Noveck watching demonstration of mobile Kansas Business Center prototype developed by Greg Elin.</em></p>
<p>Alongside this work, Dazza developed a presentation on the MIT prototype architecture and attended the conference in support of the state of Kansas. As an outcome of this conference and presentation, SOS has developed numerous professional contacts with regard to the KBC and remains in contact with Dr. Noveck and the principals of the NYU Governance Lab with regard to potential future initiatives, including the KBC.
