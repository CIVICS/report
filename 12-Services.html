<h3>Services</h3>

<h4>Assistance in Starting or Maintaining a Business</h4>

<p>The specific transactions that can be conducted by users of the site with the Kansas Secretary of State’s office and the Kansas Department of Revenue sit within a framework of supporting information and services provided by Network Kansas (see http://www.networkkansas.com/about).</p>

<p>A Google Search of this domain reveals the KBC site is composed of about twenty (20) html pages that are accessible outside the login page.</p>

<p>The primary navigation of the website is divided into four sections intended to address questions related to phases in the life of a business: Thinking; Starting; Maintaining; Closing.  The web site also provides free access to referral coordinators at Network Kansas via a toll-free number and a link to a “Live Support Chat” function to help users answer questions in these areas. The site also has links to a Resource Navigator that directs users to “more than 400 resources that are ready to help.” Finally, it provides links into the materials hosted on the Network Kansas website (see above) to help answer questions and provide overall guidance to businesses on a variety of issues.
Network Kansas officials report that the Kansas Business Center website is a significant driver of referrals to the assistance they provide, which now total close to 200 per month (from all sources).</p>
