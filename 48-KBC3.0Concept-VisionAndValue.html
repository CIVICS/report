<h2>Kansas Business Center 3.0 Concept</h2>

<h3>Vision and Value</h3>

<p>The Kansas Business Center can enable an efficient and effective relationship between business and government that materially advances the aims of business for a thriving economic environment and aims of government to achieve efficient and effective public administration in the interest of all Kansans.  The innovation that can enable breakthrough results for Kansas Business Center has already occurred in the broader environment loosely called “web 2.0” and need only be adopted by and adapted for use.</p>

<p>There is much value and potential to be had from the innovation emerging today, as can be seen in the brief summary above.  The strategic task for INK now is to learn about, discuss and decide which approaches can best serve to achieve the purposes, goals and objectives intended by the INK enabling legislation and specifically through the vehicle of redesign for the Kansas Business Center.</p>
