<h3>Organizations</h3>

<h4>Gov 3.0</h4>

<p>Since the last refresh of the Kansas Business Center, and, especially at the present time, there has been increasing attention on innovation in the delivery of government services through use of Web 2.0/3.0 technologies.  The following list is not exhaustive, but provides a brief summary of the types of resources and approaches being used that should be considered in finalizing an approach to scoping and implementation of an enhanced KBC and Information Network of Kansas innovation.</p>

<h4>State and Local</h4>

<p>Code for America (http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/)
Code for America is a non-profit that brings together web professionals with municipal government through a fellowship program for the purpose of devising and implementation innovative technology solutions to local problems. They have several programs, one of which has participants working in Kansas City (KCMO and Wyandotte Unified Government), another of which built an application called OpenCounter for the City of Santa Cruz that is focused on permitting for small business startups and is built on open source code (see http://opencounter.cityofsantacruz.com/).</p>

<p>New Urban Mechanics http://www.newurbanmechanics.org/)
Started as part of the Mayor’s office in Boston and expanded to Philadelphia, the website states that “this office serves as each City’s innovation incubator, building partnerships between City agencies and outside institutions and entrepreneurs to pilot projects (in Boston) that address resident and business needs.” This  “civic incubator” approach, in this case actually attached to city government organizationally, is an example worth investigating for as a source for ideas and methods for improving the Kansas Business Center and the operational model for the Information Network of Kansas. See also http://openplans.org/.</p>

<h4>Federal</h4>

<p>Presidential Innovation Fellows (http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows)
From the web site: This program “pairs top innovators from the private sector, non-profits, and academia with top innovators in government to collaborate during focused 6-13 month tours of duty to develop solutions that can save lives, save taxpayer money, and fuel job creation.” The projects are technology-focused and address topics from RFP creation to Open Data.  One example relevant to breaking down agency silos is the MyUSA project, a lightweight single sign-on approach across services in the federal government (see http://presidential-innovation-fellows.github.io/mygov/about/).
