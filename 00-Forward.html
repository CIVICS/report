[Draft of forward materials by Professor Alex "Sandy" Pentland, MIT]

Point One:

Systems like the Kansas Business Center have a great potential to bridge the gap needed for fully entering a digital economy. Ensuring that businesses can be started quickly and can easily navigate the maze of government registrations, permits, filings and other requirements is key to business. The value of big data requires solutions like those being proposed for Kansas Business Data and the value is immense.

Point Two:

The identity of business is sourced from state governments and is therefore an important digital resource of state government business facing systems. The act of forming a corporation, LLC or other business entity is uniquely an action of state governments in the USA, and therefore the states are the authoritative source legal identity for US business entities. Both as consumers and as providers of business identifiers via the Internet, state government plays a key role in creation and operation of a national strategy for trusted identities online.

Point Three:

The New Deal on Data requires both public and private partnership to set the rules and methods and mechanisms by which protected personal data is collected, used and shared. The approach of the Kansas Business Center is essentially premised on the web 2.0 design pattern of user authorized sharing of protected data but is implemented for the purposes of automatic forms filling and login for businesses, among other functions. This is exactly the kind of thinking that helps to bridge the gap needed to realize the value of protected private data as an asset class. Once this design pattern is used by Kansas and other governments for business interactions, the further refinements needed for citizen transactions with government will be merely an iterative step. This is a key condition for achieving the value of a big data world.
