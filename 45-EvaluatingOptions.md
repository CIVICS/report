###Evaluating Options

A proposed approach to Goals, Objectives, and Decision Making principles to be used by the parties responsible for design and implementation of the Kansas Business Center is outlined in the section above titled Begin with the End in Mind: Establishing the Mission and Success Metrics.

This section of the document outlines these decisions at a high-level, with the idea that once a formal project effort has been convened, executive decision makers will provide guidance on which options bear further investigation.  Given that the current implementation landscape involves systems and processes that vary in their level of automation and the technologies used, may not be standardized as to requirements (different pieces of information may be named or used differently), may cross both horizontal and vertical boundaries of government, and emphasis on the Kansas Business Center must compete with other program priorities for resources, achieving full online integration of business services is a daunting task. However, regardless of the approach chosen, decision makers should remain focused on the “triple constraint”:

#####Scope

The number of organizations, and the number and complexity of processes and the systems that support them, to be integrated.

#####Schedule

The time available to complete the project(s) and begin achieving benefits.

#####Cost

The amount of funding for staffing, consulting resources, computer software/hardware, and associated expenses required to develop, maintain, and enhance the solution over time.

The classic dictum in working within the triangle is “pick any two”.  “Quick and cheap, for example, often means less scope can be included. While new technologies exist to minimize reengineering by “loosely coupling” systems and processes, they are not a panacea. Longer schedules often increase risk, as more “balls in the air” in terms of changes in the external environment or new, competing priorities could cause delays or rework in the project.
