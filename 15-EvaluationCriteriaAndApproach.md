##Evaluation: Kansas Business Center (2.0)

###Evaluation Criteria and Approach

The Kansas Business Center has been deployed as an online destination for Kansas businesses for a little over ten years.  Extrapolating from recent information provided about its use, the site has likely received millions of page views during its life to-date and is considered an integral part of service delivery to new and existing businesses by a key partner in supporting business activity in the state, Network Kansas.

From this perspective, the Kansas Business Center can be considered a success.  The fact that content from Network Kansas is delivered in association with the website, and that a “live chat” feature is available to support users attempting to navigate the process of starting or maintaining a business is a real plus. Finally, in a review of both state and Information Network of Kansas planning documents, and a strategic plan for economic development in the state, enhancement of the Kansas Business Center continues to be featured as a goal.

Absent this, multiple perspectives can be used. We have settled upon the following four criteria as critical at this point in its development.
