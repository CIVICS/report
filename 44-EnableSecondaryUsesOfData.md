###Enable Secondary Uses of Data

#####An information and technical architecture that anticipates secondary uses of data (“Data Exhaust”) generated from transactions and captures and exposes data for reuse.

As noted earlier in this report, data about the transactions carried out through an expanded Kansas Business Center can have value for a variety of purposes, from improving the service delivered by the site, to fueling policy analysis related to economic development, to secondary uses by third parties in mash ups. While interviews with policy makers and potential users can help develop the foundation for the type of data to be collected, the architecture of the site should be designed in such a way as to make data available to the appropriate users in a timely and reusable (standards-based) fashion.
