###What to Measure

In order to make the best available evaluation of whether desired or expected outcomes intended to result from the KBC have occurred, a set of relevant measures and criteria will be needed.  

#####KBC Management Metrics: Traceable Outcomes, Goals and Objectives 

Operations and processes of Kansas Business Center can be defined, designed and deployed such that the right data is created for measuring success. System performance metrics tied to goals and objective can be linked to measurable outcomes for stakeholders.  The outcomes for businesses and the economy can in turn provide a traceable link to realization of the big picture purposes and vision intended for the KBC.  Management of the operations of Kansas Business Center can be anchored upon and evaluated against a regularized system-wide set of such performance metrics.  

#####Example Goal: Promote New Business Formation

Let's say that the driving goal for the KBC ultimately agreed by all parties concerned were the promotion of increasing the number of new businesses created in Kansas.  The measures of achievement for this goal could be accomplished directly in a fairly superficial way by simply coding an annual report of the total number of business entities created and observing whether the number was increasing or not.  However, the lower level objectives that comprise a high level goal will have their own particular measures based on what types of data are available and relevant.  It would be necessary to break the general goal of new business formation into smaller clusters of objectives and tasks in part to develop better tuned and more actionable business intelligence.
